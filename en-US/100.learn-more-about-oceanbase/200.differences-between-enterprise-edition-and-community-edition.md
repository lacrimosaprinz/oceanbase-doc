# Differences between the Enterprise Edition and the Community Edition

OceanBase Database is available in two forms: OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition and OceanBase Database Community Edition.

* OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition is a native, enterprise-level distributed database developed independently by the OceanBase team. It provides financial-grade high availability on commodity hardware and introduces a new city-level disaster recovery standard known as "Five IDCs across Three Regions". As the world's first distributed database to pass the TPC-C benchmark test, it can support over 1,500 nodes in a single cluster. Additionally, it features cloud-native architecture, strong consistency, and high compatibility with other popular databases such as Oracle and MySQL.

* OceanBase Database Community Edition is a standalone distributed and integrated database that is fully compatible with MySQL. It leverages a native distributed architecture and incorporates enterprise-level features such as high availability suitable for financial-grade applications, transparent horizontal scaling, distributed transactions, multitenancy, and syntax compatibility. OceanBase Database Community Edition is an open-source database management system that not only supports connectivity with virtualization and big data applications and products, but also supports a comprehensive range of GUI-based development tools, O&M and monitoring tools, and data migration tools. Furthermore, it offers open APIs and various eco-capabilities to meet the diverse business requirements of enterprises or individuals.
