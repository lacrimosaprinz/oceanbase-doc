# Overview

This topic describes the compatibility between OceanBase Database's Oracle mode and native Oracle Database.

OceanBase Database is compatible with Oracle Database in terms of basic features, including the data types, SQL features, and database objects. OceanBase Database is compatible with all PL-related R&D features of Oracle Database. In terms of advanced features such as database security, backup and restore, high availability, and optimizer, OceanBase Database provides sound compatibility with and even outperforms Oracle Database. Therefore, you can smoothly migrate data and services from Oracle Database to OceanBase Database without spending much time learning everything about OceanBase Database.

However, due to the differences in the underlying architecture and product form between the two, OceanBase Database does not support some features of Oracle Database and differs from it in some aspects. This topic describes the compatibility between OceanBase Database and Oracle Database in the following aspects:

* SQL data types

* Built-in functions

* SQL syntax

* Procedural languages

* System views

* Character sets and collations

* Database object management

* Security features

* Backup and restore

* SQL engine

* Unsupported features

## SQL data types

Oracle Database supports 24 data types and OceanBase Database supports 20 of them. For more information, see [SQL data types](../400.compatibility-with-oracle/200.sql-data-type.md). OceanBase Database does not support the `LONG` and `LONG RAW` data types because they are outdated.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>OceanBase Database supports large object (LOB) data types sized no more than 48 MB. Due to the poor performance of LOB data types, we recommend that you do not use them in complex scenarios. For more information, see <a href="../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/300.basic-elements-of-oracle-mode/100.built-in-data-types-of-oracle-mode/600.large-object-data-type-of-oracle-mode/100.data-types-of-large-objects-of-oracle-mode.md">Overview of LOB data types</a>. </p>
  </main>

## Built-in functions

Oracle Database supports 312 built-in functions and OceanBase Database supports 176 of them. For more information about the supported functions, see [Built-in functions](../400.compatibility-with-oracle/300.built-in-functions.md).

## SQL syntax

OceanBase Database supports most of the SQL syntax in Oracle Database.

For some syntax, OceanBase Database will return an "unsupported syntax" error because the corresponding features are unavailable.

**SELECT**

* The following set operators are supported: `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `MINUS`.

* The following syntax is supported for viewing execution plans:

   ```sql
   EXPLAIN [explain_type] dml_statement;
   explain_type:
       BASIC
     | OUTLINE
     | EXTENDED
     | EXTENDED_NOADDR
     | PARTITIONS
