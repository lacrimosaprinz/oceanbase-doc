## Prerequisites

* You have installed Python 3.x and pip.
* You have installed OceanBase Database and created a MySQL tenant.

## Procedure

1. Check the versions of Python and pip.
2. Install the `mysqlclient` library.
3. Obtain the connection information of OceanBase Database.
4. Modify the database connection information in the `config.py` file.
5. Run the `main.py` file.
6. Perform database operations in the CLI.

### Step 1: Check the versions of Python and pip

Open the command prompt or PowerShell terminal, and run the `python --version` and `pip --version` commands to check whether Python and pip are properly installed.

**Here is an example:**

```shell
PS C:\Windows\system32> python --version
Python 3.7.0
PS C:\Windows\system32> pip --version
pip 22.3.1 from d:\python\python37\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.7)
```

### Step 2: Install the `mysqlclient` library

When you install the `mysqlclient` library, you must compile and link the MySQL C API to connect to OceanBase Database. Therefore, you must install the development files of MySQL Connector C or MySQL C API for later compilation.

tab Windows

**Method 1: Install the `mysqlclient` library using precompiled binary files**

In a Windows environment, you can install the `mysqlclient` library using precompiled binary files. Download the `whl` file that is compatible with your Python version and operating system platform from [Download files](https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/#files) and use the `pip install` command to install it.

Here is an example:

Open the command prompt or PowerShell terminal and run the following commands to install the necessary Python libraries.

1. Navigate to the directory where the `whl` file is stored.

    ```sehll
    cd D:\download
    ```

2. Run the following command to install the `mysqlclient` library:

    ```shell
    PS D:\download> pip install mysqlclient-2.2.0-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl
    Processing d:\download\mysqlclient-2.2.0-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl
    Installing collected packages: mysqlclient
    Successfully installed mysqlclient-2.2.0
    ```

**Method 2: Directly install the `mysqlclient` library**

1. Install MySQL.

    Before you can use `mysqlclient`, you need to install the MySQL database server. The `mysqlclient` library depends on the MySQL client programs and library files to communicate with MySQL. You can download the installer from the [MySQL Community Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/) page and follow the instructions to install it.

2. Install a C compiler.

    In a Windows environment, you can choose to install Visual Studio or MinGW as the C compiler.

3. Install development tools.

    In a Windows environment, you can use MySQL Connector/C to obtain the MySQL development libraries. To install MySQL Connector/C, perform the following steps:

      1. Go to the [MySQL Community Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/c/) page.

      2. On this page, select the appropriate operating system type and version, and download the corresponding installation package.

      3. Run the downloaded installation package and follow the instructions in the installation wizard.

      4. During the installation, select the **Custom** installation type and ensure that **Development Components** are installed.

      5. After the installation is complete, restart the computer.

4. Install the `mysqlclient` library.

    Open the command prompt or PowerShell terminal and run the following commands to install the necessary Python library.

   1. Run the following command to navigate to the `python-mysqlclient` directory:

       ```shell
       cd python-mysqlclient
       ```

   2. Run the following command to install the `mysqlclient` library:

       ```shell
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>You can also directly run the <code>pip install mysqlclient</code> command to install the <code>mysqlclient</code> library.</p>
    </main>

tab Linux

In a Linux environment, Python C extensions rely on the `Python.h` header file, which is usually contained in the `python3-devel` package. If the `python3-devel` package is not installed, an error will be returned when you compile the MySQL C API, indicating that the `Python.h` header file cannot be found.

To resolve this issue, open the command prompt or PowerShell terminal and run the following commands to install the necessary Python libraries.

1. Check whether the `python3-devel` package is installed.

   Run the following command to check whether the `python3-devel` package is installed:

   ```shell
   rpm -q python3-devel
   ```

   * If the package is installed, the following information is displayed:

      ```shell
      python3-devel-3.x.x-x.el7.x86_64
      ```

      Here, `3.x.x` indicates the version of Python3, and `x86_64` indicates the CPU architecture of the system.

   * If the package is not installed, the following information is displayed:

      ```shell
      package python3-devel is not installed
      ```

      In this case, you can run the following command to install the `python3-devel` package:

      ```shell
      sudo yum install python3-devel
      ```

      After the installation is complete, run the `rpm -q python3-devel` command again to check whether the installation is successful.

2. Install the `mysqlclient` library.

   1. Run the following command to navigate to the `python-mysqlclient` project directory:

      ```shell
      cd python-mysqlclient
      ```

   2. Run the following command to install the `mysqlclient` library:

      ```shell
      sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>You can also directly run the <code>sudo pip install mysqlclient</code> command to install the <code>mysqlclient</code> library. </p>
    </main>

:::

### Step 3: Obtain the connection information of OceanBase Database

Contact the deployment personnel or administrator of OceanBase Database to obtain the database connection string.

```shell
obclient -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

where

* `$host` specifies the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), this parameter is the IP address of an ODP. For direct connection, this parameter is the IP address of an OBServer node.
* `$port` specifies the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
* `$database_name` specifies the name of the database to access.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>The user used to connect to the tenant must have the <code>CREATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> privileges on the database. For more information about user privileges, see <a href="../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md">Privilege types in MySQL mode</a>. </p>
    </main>

* `$user_name` specifies the tenant account. For connection through ODP, the tenant account can be in the `username@tenant name#cluster name` or `cluster name:tenant name:username` format. For direct connection, the tenant account is in the `username@tenant name` format.
* `$password` specifies the account password.

For more information about connection strings, see [Connect to an OceanBase Database tenant by using OBClient](../../100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/300.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md).

**Here is an example:**

```shell
obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -utest_user001@mysql001 -p****** -Dtest
```

### Step 4: Modify the database connection information in the config.py file

Modify the database connection information in the `python-mysqlclient/config.py` file based on the information obtained in **Step 3: Obtain the connection information of OceanBase Database**.

1. Go to the `python-mysqlclient` project directory.

2. Modify the database connection information in the `config.py` file.

   * In a Windows environment, use the text editor to open the `config.py` file and modify the database connection information based on the actual situation.
   * In a Linux environment, use the `vi config.py` or `vim config.py` command to open the `config.py` file and modify the database connection information based on the actual situation.

   The following example shows the database connection information in the `config.py` file:

   ```python
   OCEANBASE_CONFIG = {
       'host': '10.10.10.1',
       'port': 2881,
       'user': 'test_user001@mysql001',
       'password': '******',
       'database': 'test',
       'charset': 'utf8mb4'
   }
   ```

### Step 5: Run the main.py file

Open the command prompt or PowerShell terminal, and run the `python main.py` command to start the program.

1. Go to the `python-mysqlclient` project directory.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   cd /home/admin/python-mysqlclient
   ```

2. Run the following command to start the `main.py` program:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   Table created successfully
   Instruction: 1.Insert Data; 2.Query Data; 3.Exit.
   Enter the command [1/2/3]>
   ```

### Step 6: Perform database operations in the CLI

* Example: Successfully insert data

   1. In the CLI, enter `1` and press **Enter**.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      Enter the command [1/2/3]> 1
      ```

   2. After the `Enter name:` prompt, enter a name and press **Enter**.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      Enter name: A1
      ```

   3. After the `Enter age:` prompt, enter an age and press **Enter**.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      Enter age: 18
      ```

   4. The `Record inserted successfully` message is displayed, indicating that the data is successfully inserted. Finally, an instruction is displayed, prompting you to enter `1`, `2`, or `3` and press **Enter** to perform the corresponding operation.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      Record inserted successfully
      Instruction: 1.Insert Data; 2.Query Data; 3.Exit.
      Enter the command [1/2/3]>
      ```

* Example: Failed to insert data

   1. In the CLI, enter `1` and press **Enter**.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      Enter the command [1/2/3]> 1
      ```

   2. After the `Enter name:` prompt, enter a name and press **Enter**.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      Enter name: A2
      ```

   3. After the `Enter age:` prompt, enter an age and press **Enter**.

        <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>The data type of the age field is INT. </p>
        </main>

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      Enter age: 18
      ```

   4. The `(1366, 'Incorrect integer value')` message is displayed, indicating that the data failed to be inserted. Finally, an instruction is displayed, prompting you to enter `1`, `2`, or `3` and press **Enter** to perform the corresponding operation.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      (1366, 'Incorrect integer value')
      Instruction: 1.Insert Data; 2.Query Data; 3.Exit.
      Enter the command [1/2/3]>
      ```

* Example: Query data

   1. In the CLI, enter `2` and press **Enter**.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      Enter the command [1/2/3]> 2
      ```

   2. The data of the table is displayed. Finally, an instruction is displayed, prompting you to enter `1`, `2`, or `3` and press **Enter** to perform the corresponding operation.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      (1, 'A1', 18)
      Instruction: 1.Insert Data; 2.Query Data; 3.Exit.
      Enter the command [1/2/3]>
      ```

* Example: Enter an invalid command

   1. In the CLI, enter a value other than `1/2/3` and press **Enter**.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      Enter the command [1/2/3]> A
      ```

   2. The following error message is displayed: `Invalid command, please enter command again [1/2/3]`. Finally, an instruction is displayed, prompting you to enter `1`, `2`, or `3` and press **Enter** to perform the corresponding operation.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      Invalid command, please enter command again [1/2/3]
      Instruction: 1.Insert Data; 2.Query Data; 3.Exit.
      Enter the command [1/2/3]>
      ```

* Example: Exit the program

   In the CLI, enter `3` and press **Enter**.

   Here is an example:

## Project code introduction

Click [python-mysqlclient](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/3.develop/demo/python/python-mysqlclient.zip) to download the project code, which is a compressed file named `python-mysqlclient.zip`.

After decompressing it, you will find a folder named `python-mysqlclient`. The directory structure is as follows:

```shell
python-mysqlclient
├── config.py
├── db.py
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt
```

Here is a breakdown of the files and directories:

* `config.py`: manages database connection configurations.
* `db.py`: operates the databases, such as creating tables, inserting data, and querying data.
* `main.py`: the entry to the application and provides a simple CLI. You can enter commands in the CLI to perform corresponding operations.
* `requirements.txt`: lists the Python libraries required for the project and their version requirements.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The code provided in this topic only lists the version requirement for the <code>mysqlclient</code> library. You can run the <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> command to automatically install the required library. </p>
    </main>

### Code in config.py

When you use Python to connect to a database, you need to specify the database connection parameters. These parameters can be placed in a separate configuration file, such as the `config.py` file. You can encapsulate the parameters in a dictionary so that other Python files can reference the dictionary to connect to a database, without the need to write the parameters to each file.

Code in the `config.py` file obtained in this topic defines a dictionary variable named `OCEANBASE_CONFIG`, which is used to manage the connection parameters of OceanBase Database.

**The sample code is as follows:**

```python
OCEANBASE_CONFIG = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'port': port,
    'user': 'user_name',
    'password': '',
    'database': 'db_name',
    'charset': 'utf8mb4'
}
```

where

* `host` specifies the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, this parameter is the IP address of an ODP. For direct connection, this parameter is the IP address of an OBServer node.
* `port` specifies the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. The default value is `2881` for direct connection and `2883` for connection through ODP.
* `user` specifies the username for connecting to the database. It is in the format of **{username}@{tenant name}** for direct connection or in the format of **{username}@{tenant name}#{cluster name}** for connection through ODP. For more information about how to connect to OceanBase Database, see [Overview of connection methods](../../100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).
* `password` specifies the password for connecting to the database.
* `database` specifies the name of the database that you want to connect to.
* `charset` specifies the character set for connecting to the database.

### Code in db.py

The `db.py` file is a Python module in which database operations are encapsulated. You can use it to add, delete, modify, and query data in a database.

To configure the `db.py` file, perform the following steps:

1. Import the MySQLdb module and database connection parameters.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   import MySQLdb
   from config import OCEANBASE_CONFIG
   ```

2. Define a function for creating a table.

   1. Define the `create_table` function to create a table named `test_tbl1` in OceanBase Database.
   2. Use the `with` statement to manage the lifecycle of database connections and cursor objects.
   This ensures that database connections and cursor objects can be securely closed without memory leaks.
   3. Define an SQL statement, execute the statement, and print the execution result or error message.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   def create_table():
       with MySQLdb.connect(**OCEANBASE_CONFIG) as conn:
           with conn.cursor() as cursor:
               try:
                   create_table_sql = """
                       CREATE TABLE test_tbl1 (
                           id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
                           name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                           age INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
                           PRIMARY KEY (id)
                       ) ENGINE=OCEANBASE AUTO_INCREMENT=1
                   """
                   cursor.execute(create_table_sql)

                   print("Table created successfully")
               except MySQLdb.Error as err:
                   print(err)
   ```

3. Define a function for inserting data.

   1. Define the `insert_record` function to insert a record into a specified table.
   The record contains the `name` and `age` fields.
   2. Use the `with` statement to manage the lifecycle of database connections and cursor objects.
   This ensures that database connections and cursor objects can be securely closed without memory leaks.
   3. Define an SQL statement, execute the statement, commit the transaction, and print the execution result or error message.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   def insert_record(table_name, name, age):
       with MySQLdb.connect(**OCEANBASE_CONFIG) as conn:
           with conn.cursor() as cursor:
               try:
                   insert_sql = f"INSERT INTO {table_name} (name, age) VALUES (%s, %s)"
                   cursor.execute(insert_sql, (name, age))
                   conn.commit()

                   print("Record inserted successfully")
               except MySQLdb.Error as err:
                   print(err)
   ```

4. Define a function for querying table data.

   1. Define the `select_all` function to query all records in a specified table.
   2. Use the `with` statement to manage the lifecycle of database connections and cursor objects.
   This ensures that database connections and cursor objects can be securely closed without memory leaks.
   3. Define an SQL statement, execute the statement, traverse query results, and print all records.
   If an error occurs, capture the error and print the error message.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   def select_all(table_name):
       with MySQLdb.connect(**OCEANBASE_CONFIG) as conn:
           with conn.cursor() as cursor:
               try:
                   select_sql = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}"
                   cursor.execute(select_sql)
                   result = cursor.fetchall()
                   for row in result:
                       print(row)

               except MySQLdb.Error as err:
                   print(err)
   ```

### Code in main.py

The `main.py` file in this topic shows how to use Python and MySQLdb to operate a database. The file provides a CLI where you can run commands to perform database operations. You can use this program to implement basic database operations such as creating tables, inserting records, and querying all records.

To configure the `main.py` file, perform the following steps:

1. Import the functions defined in the `db.py` file.

   Import the `create_table`, `insert_record`, and `select_all` functions from the `db` module.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   from db import create_table, insert_record, select_all
   ```

2. Define a function for operating databases.

   Define the `main` function to implement a simple CLI program for database operations. The program calls the `create_table` function to create a table named `test_tbl1`, and then enters a `while` loop to wait for you to enter a command. The program calls the corresponding function to insert or query data based on your command until you enter the `3` command to exit the program. If you enter an invalid command, the program prompts you to re-enter a command.

   Based on the different input commands, the program executes different operations, including data insertion (command `1`), data query (command `2`), and program exit (command `3`).

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   def main():
       create_table()
       while True:
           print("Instruction: 1.Insert Data; 2.Query Data; 3.Exit.")

           command = input("Enter the command [1/2/3]> ")
           if command == "1":
               name = input("Enter name:")
               age = input("Enter age:")
               insert_record("test_tbl1", name, age)
           elif command == "2":
               select_all("test_tbl1")
           elif command == "3":
               break
           else:
               print("Invalid command, please enter command again [1/2/3]")
   ```

3. Set the application scenario of the `main` function.

   Set the `main` function to be called only when the `main.py` file is directly executed. If the `main` module is just imported into another module, the `main` function is not called.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>This setting can avoid automatic execution of the <code>main</code> function when the <code>main</code> module is imported, thus ensuring the reusability and scalability of the program. </p>
    </main>
