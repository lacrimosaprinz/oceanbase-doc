          Download the python-pymysql sample project
      </a>
</div>

## Prerequisites

* You have installed Python 3.x and pip.
* You have installed OceanBase Database and created a MySQL tenant.

## Procedure

1. Check the versions of Python and pip.
2. Install the `PyMySQL` library.
3. Obtain the connection information of OceanBase Database.
4. Modify the database connection information in the `config.py` file.
5. Run the `main.py` file.

### Step 1: Check the versions of Python and pip

Open the command prompt or PowerShell terminal, and run the `python --version` and `pip --version` commands to check whether Python and pip are properly installed.

**Here is an example:**

```shell
PS C:\Windows\system32> python --version
Python 3.7.0
PS C:\Windows\system32> pip --version
pip 22.3.1 from d:\python\python37\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.7)
```

### Step 2: Install the PyMySQL library

Open the command prompt or PowerShell terminal and run the following commands to install the PyMySQL library.

1. Run the following command to go to the `python-pymysql` project directory:

   **Here is an example:**

   ```shell
   cd python-pymysql
   ```

2. Run the following command to install the `PyMySQL` library:

   **Here is an example:**

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>You can also directly run the <code>pip install pymysql</code> command to install the <code>PyMySQL</code> library. </p>
</main>

### Step 3: Obtain the connection information of OceanBase Database

Contact the deployment personnel or administrator of OceanBase Database to obtain the database connection string.

```shell
obclient -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

where

* `$host` specifies the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), this parameter is the IP address of an ODP. For direct connection, this parameter is the IP address of an OBServer node.
* `$port` specifies the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
* `$database_name` specifies the name of the database to access.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>The user used to connect to the tenant must have the <code>CREATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>DROP</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> privileges on the database. For more information about user privileges, see <a href="../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md">Privilege types in MySQL mode</a>. </p>
    </main>

* `$user_name` specifies the tenant account. For connection through ODP, the tenant account can be in the `username@tenant name#cluster name` or `cluster name:tenant name:username` format. For direct connection, the tenant account is in the `username@tenant name` format.
* `$password` specifies the account password.

For more information about connection strings, see [Connect to an OceanBase tenant by using OBClient](../../100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/300.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md).

**Here is an example:**

```shell
obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -utest_user001@mysql001 -p****** -Dtest
```

### Step 4: Modify the database connection information in the config.py file

Modify the database connection information in the `python-pymysql/config.py` file based on the information obtained in **Step 3: Obtain the connection information of OceanBase Database**.

1. Go to the `python-pymysql` project directory.

2. Modify the database connection information in the `config.py` file.

   * In a Windows environment, use the text editor to open the `config.py` file and modify the database connection information based on the actual situation.
   * In a Linux environment, use the `vi config.py` or `vim config.py` command to open the `config.py` file and modify the database connection information based on the actual situation.

   The following example shows the database connection information in the `config.py` file:

   ```python
   DB_CONFIG = {
       'host': '10.10.10.1',
       'port': 2881,
       'user': 'test_user001@mysql001',
       'password': '******',
       'database': 'test',
       'charset': 'utf8mb4'
   }
   ```

### Step 5: Run the main.py file

Open the command prompt or PowerShell terminal, and run the `main.py` file to query data and output the results.

1. Go to the `python-pymysql` project directory.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   cd D:\demo\demo\python-pymysql
   ```

2. Run the `main.py` file.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   2023-11-10 16:56:48,021 - INFO - Start executing the script
   2023-11-10 16:56:48,021 - INFO - Start creating the table

   (1, 'John', 20)
   (2, 'Lucy', 25)
   (3, 'Tom', 30)
   2023-11-10 16:56:48,737 - INFO - Start dropping the table
   2023-11-10 16:56:48,999 - INFO - Table dropped successfully
   2023-11-10 16:56:48,999 - INFO - Script execution completed
   ```

After decompressing it, you will find a folder named `python-pymysql`. The directory structure is as follows:

```shell
python-pymysql
├── config.py
├── test_sql.py
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt
```

Here is a breakdown of the files and directories:

* `config.py`: stores database connection configurations.
* `test_sql.py`: stores SQL statements.
* `main.py`: the entry to the program and provides a simple CLI for basic database operations such as creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and dropping tables.
* `requirements.txt`: lists the Python libraries required for the project and their version requirements.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The code provided in this topic only lists the version requirement for the <code>PyMySQL</code> library. You can run the <code>sudo pip install -r requirements.txt</code> command to automatically install the required library. </p>
    </main>

### Code in config.py

Code in the `config.py` file defines the database connection information.  

The information specifies the IP address, port number, username, password, database name, and character set for connecting to OceanBase Database.

**The sample code is as follows:**

```python
DB_CONFIG = {
    'host': '$host',
    'port': $port,
    'user': '$user_name',
    'password': '$password',
    'database': '$database_name',
    'charset': 'utf8mb4'
}
```

where

* `$host` specifies the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, this parameter is the IP address of an ODP. For direct connection, this parameter is the IP address of an OBServer node.
* `$port` specifies the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. The default value is `2881` for direct connection and `2883` for connection through ODP.
* `$user_name` specifies the username for connecting to the database.
* `$password` specifies the password for connecting to the database.
* `$database_name` specifies the name of the database to connect to.
* `charset` specifies the character set for connecting to the database.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>You need to modify the parameter values in the sample code based on the actual environment and database settings. </p>
    </main>

### Code in test_sql.py

Code in the `test_sql.py` file obtained in this topic defines SQL statements for database operations such as creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and dropping tables. These SQL statements can be executed after the application connects to the database through PyMySQL.

To configure the `test_sql.py` file, perform the following steps:

1. Define an SQL statement for creating a table.

   Define the SQL statement that creates the `test_pymysql` table with three fields: `id`, `name`, and `age`, where `id` is an auto-increment primary key.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   CREATE_TABLE_SQL = '''
   CREATE TABLE test_pymysql (
   id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
   name VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
   age INT(11) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (id)
   )
   '''
   ```

2. Define an SQL statement for inserting data.

   Define the SQL statement that inserts three rows into the `test_pymysql` table, each containing the `name` and `age` fields. The value of each field is passed in as a placeholder `%s` when the SQL statement is executed.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   INSERT_DATA_SQL = '''
   INSERT INTO test_pymysql (name, age) VALUES
   (%s, %s),
   (%s, %s),
   (%s, %s)
   '''
   ```

3. Define an SQL statement for querying data.

   Define the SQL statement that queries all data from the `test_pymysql` table.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   SELECT_DATA_SQL = '''
   SELECT * FROM test_pymysql
   '''
   ```

4. Define an SQL statement for dropping a table.

   Define the SQL statement that drops the `test_pymysql` table.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   DROP_TABLE_SQL = '''
   DROP TABLE test_pymysql
   '''
   ```

### Code in main.py

Code in the `main.py` file obtained in this topic calls the `pymysql` module to connect to the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, calls the `logging` module to output logs, and implements database operations such as creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and dropping tables.

To configure the `main.py` file, perform the following steps:

1. Import the required modules.

   1. Import the `logging` module.
   2. Import the `pymysql` module.
   3. Import the `config.py` module, which defines the database connection information.
   4. Import the `test_sql.py` module, which defines SQL statements for database operations.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   import logging
   import pymysql
   from config import DB_CONFIG
   from test_sql import CREATE_TABLE_SQL, INSERT_DATA_SQL, SELECT_DATA_SQL, DROP_TABLE_SQL
   ```

2. Set the level and format of logging, and generate an INFO log to indicate that script execution starts.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
   logging.info('Start executing the script')
   ```

3. Define a function for creating a table.

   1. Define a function named `create_table()` and generate an `INFO` log to indicate that table creation starts.
   2. Use the `with` statement to manage the lifecycle of database connections and cursor objects.
    This ensures that database connections and cursor objects can be securely closed without memory leaks.
   3. Execute the SQL statement for creating a table, commit the transaction, and generate a success log or roll back the transaction and generate an error log.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   def create_table():
       logging.info('Start creating the table')
       with pymysql.connect(**DB_CONFIG) as conn:
           with conn.cursor() as cursor:
               try:
                   cursor.execute(CREATE_TABLE_SQL)
                   conn.commit()
                   logging.info('Table creation successful')
               except Exception as e:
                   conn.rollback()
                   logging.error('Table creation failed, Reason: %s' % e)
   ```

4. Define a function for inserting data.

   1. Define a function named `insert_data()` and generate an `INFO` log to indicate that data insertion starts.
   2. Use the `with` statement to manage the lifecycle of database connections and cursor objects.
    This ensures that database connections and cursor objects can be securely closed without memory leaks.
   3. Execute the SQL statement for inserting data, commit the transaction, and generate a success log or roll back the transaction and generate an error log.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   def insert_data():
       logging.info('Start inserting data')
       with pymysql.connect(**DB_CONFIG) as conn:
           with conn.cursor() as cursor:
               try:
                   data = [('John', 20), ('Lucy', 25), ('Tom', 30)]
                   flattened_data = [d for item in data for d in item]
                   cursor.executemany(INSERT_DATA_SQL, [flattened_data])
                   conn.commit()
                   logging.info('Data insertion successful')
               except Exception as e:
                   conn.rollback()
                   logging.error('Data insertion failed, Reason: %s' % e)
   ```

5. Define a function for querying data.

   1. Define a function named `select_data()` to query data from a database.
   2. Use the `with` statement to manage the lifecycle of database connections and cursor objects.
   This ensures that database connections and cursor objects can be securely closed without memory leaks.
   3. Use the `execute()` method to execute the SQL statement defined by `SELECT_DATA_SQL` to query data.
   4. Use the `fetchall()` method to obtain the query results and output the results row by row through the `for` loop.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   def select_data():
       with pymysql.connect(**DB_CONFIG) as conn:
           with conn.cursor() as cursor:
               cursor.execute(SELECT_DATA_SQL)
               result = cursor.fetchall()
               for row in result:
                   print(row)
   ```

6. Define a function for dropping a table.

   Define the `drop_table()` function that uses pre-defined database connection information (`DB_CONFIG`) and the SQL statement for dropping tables (`DROP_TABLE_SQL`). The function drops tables and prints logs to show the operation result. If the table fails to be dropped, an error message is printed.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   def drop_table():
       logging.info('Start dropping the table')
       with pymysql.connect(**DB_CONFIG) as conn:
           with conn.cursor() as cursor:
               try:
                   cursor.execute(DROP_TABLE_SQL)
                   conn.commit()
                   logging.info('Table dropped successfully')
               except Exception as e:
                   conn.rollback()
                   logging.error('Table drop failed, Reason: %s' % e)
   ```

7. Define the entry to the program, which is mainly used to perform database operations.

   First, check whether the current module is running as the main program. If yes, perform the following operations:

   1. Call the `create_table()` function to create a table.
   2. Call the `insert_data()` function to insert data into a table.
   3. Call the `select_data()` function to query data from a table.
   4. Call the `drop_table()` function to drop a table.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       create_table()
       insert_data()
       select_data()
       drop_table()
   ```

8. Generate an `INFO` log to indicate that script execution is complete.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```python
   logging.info('Script execution completed')
   ```
