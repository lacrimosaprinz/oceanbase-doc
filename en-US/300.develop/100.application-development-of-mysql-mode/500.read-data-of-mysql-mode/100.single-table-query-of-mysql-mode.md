# Single-table queries

A single-table query is performed only in one table. You can perform single-table queries to retrieve, filter, and sort data.

This topic describes how to use the `SELECT` statement to perform single-table queries on data in the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database.

## Syntax

The syntax of a single-table query is as follows:

```sql
SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] select_list FROM table_name
              [ WHERE query_condition ]
              [ GROUP BY group_by_expression ]
              [ HAVING group_condition ]
              [ ORDER BY column_list ][ASC | DESC]
              [ LIMIT limit_clause ]

column_list:
 column_name[,column_name...]
```

For more information about how to use the `SELECT` statement, see [SELECT](../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/600.sql-statement-of-mysql-mode/8100.select-of-mysql-mode/100.select-of-mysql-mode.md). 

When the keywords `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` are used together, there are specific restrictions on the order. The execution order of these keywords is as follows:

1. Execute `FROM` to find the required table.

2. Execute `WHERE` to specify the constraint conditions.

3. Execute `GROUP BY` to group or aggregate each retrieved record. If `GROUP BY` is not executed, all records are considered a group.

4. Execute `HAVING` to filter the grouped results.

5. Execute `SELECT`.

6. Execute `DISTINCT` to remove duplicate rows.

7. Execute `ORDER BY` to sort the results in ascending or descending order based on the conditions.

8. Execute `LIMIT` to limit the number of records.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>The difference between <code>WHERE</code> and <code>HAVING</code> is that <code>WHERE</code> filters data before grouping or aggregation, while <code>HAVING</code> filters data after grouping and returns the entire query results. </p>
  </main>

## Examples

Assume that there is a student information table `student`, which includes the following fields: student id (`id`), student name (`name`), gender (`gender`), age (`age`), score (`score`), and enrollment date (`enrollment_date`). The `gender` field is represented by the numbers 0 and 1 for female and male, respectively.

The data is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+--------+-----+-------+-----------------+
| id | name      | gender | age | score | enrollment_date |
+----+-----------+--------+-----+-------+-----------------+
|  1 | Emma      |      0 |  20 |    85 | 2021-09-01      |
|  2 | William   |      1 |  21 |  90.5 | 2021-09-02      |
|  3 | Olivia    |      0 |  19 |  95.5 | 2021-09-03      |
|  4 | James     |      1 |  20 |  87.5 | 2021-09-03      |
|  5 | Sophia    |      0 |  20 |  91.5 | 2021-09-05      |
|  6 | Benjamin  |      1 |  21 |  96.5 | 2021-09-01      |
|  7 | Ava       |      0 |  22 |  89.5 | 2021-09-06      |
|  8 | Michael   |      1 |  18 |  93.5 | 2021-09-08      |
|  9 | Charlotte |      1 |  19 |    88 | 2021-09-06      |
| 10 | Ethan     |      1 |  20 |    92 | 2021-09-01      |
+----+-----------+--------+-----+-------+-----------------+
```

### SELECT queries

#### Query all columns

* You can execute the `SELECT * FROM student;` statement to query all student information.

* You can also manually list all the fields by using the statement `SELECT id, name, gender, age, score, enrollment_date FROM student;`.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Although you can use an asterisk (<code>*</code>) to quickly list all fields, manually listing all fields in the statement improves query performance and code readability and maintainability. </p>
</main>

Example 1: Query the data of all rows in the `student` table, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, `gender`, `age`, `score`, and `enrollment_date` columns in each row.

```sql
SELECT id,name,gender,age,score,enrollment_date FROM student;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+--------+-----+-------+-----------------+
| id | name      | gender | age | score | enrollment_date |
+----+-----------+--------+-----+-------+-----------------+
|  1 | Emma      |      0 |  20 |    85 | 2021-09-01      |
|  2 | William   |      1 |  21 |  90.5 | 2021-09-02      |
|  3 | Olivia    |      0 |  19 |  95.5 | 2021-09-03      |
|  4 | James     |      1 |  20 |  87.5 | 2021-09-03      |
|  5 | Sophia    |      0 |  20 |  91.5 | 2021-09-05      |
|  6 | Benjamin  |      1 |  21 |  96.5 | 2021-09-01      |
|  7 | Ava       |      0 |  22 |  89.5 | 2021-09-06      |
|  8 | Michael   |      1 |  18 |  93.5 | 2021-09-08      |
|  9 | Charlotte |      1 |  19 |    88 | 2021-09-06      |
| 10 | Ethan     |      1 |  20 |    92 | 2021-09-01      |
+----+-----------+--------+-----+-------+-----------------+
10 rows in set
```

#### Query specified columns

You can query data in specified columns based on column names.

Example 2: Query the data of all rows in the `student` table, and return the data from the `id` and `name` columns in each row.

```sql
SELECT id,name FROM student;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+
| id | name      |
+----+-----------+
|  1 | Emma      |
|  2 | William   |
|  3 | Olivia    |
|  4 | James     |
|  5 | Sophia    |
|  6 | Benjamin  |
|  7 | Ava       |
|  8 | Michael   |
|  9 | Charlotte |
| 10 | Ethan     |
+----+-----------+
10 rows in set
```

#### Query calculated values

You can process the data of specified columns in a query.

Example 3: Query the data of the `id`, `name`, and `age` columns of all rows in the `student` table, and increase the value of the `age` column in each row by `1`. The result will contain three columns: `id`, `name`, and `age+1`.

```sql
SELECT id,name,age+1 FROM student;
```

For more information about how to process data of specified columns in a query, see **Use operators and functions in queries**.

### Conditional queries

To query data that satisfies specific conditions, add a `WHERE` clause to the `SELECT` statement.

The `WHERE` keyword can be followed by one or more conditions. These conditions are used to filter the data, and only the data that satisfies the `WHERE` conditions will be returned.

The commonly used query conditions in the `WHERE` clause are shown in the table below.

| Query condition type | Predicate |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Comparison query | `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`, and `<>` |
| Logical query (multiple conditions supported in a query) | `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` |
| Fuzzy query (matching by characters) | `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` |
| Interval query (with a specified range) | `BETWEEN AND` and `NOT BETWEEN AND` |
| Query with a specified set | `IN` and `NOT IN` |
| NULL value query | `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` |

For more information about query conditions, see [Comparison operators](../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/200.operator-of-mysql-mode/500.comparison-operators-of-mysql-mode.md).

#### Queries with comparison operators

Comparison operators include equal to (`=`), greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), greater than or equal to (`>=`), less than or equal to (`<=`), and not equal to (`!=` and `<>`).

* Equal to (`=`): Query data from the specified column that is equal to the target value. If the value is of string type, it needs to be enclosed in single or double quotes. 
  

   Example 4: Query all rows in the `student` table where `gender` values are equal to `1`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, and `gender` columns in these rows.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,gender FROM student WHERE gender = 1;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+-----------+--------+
   | id | name      | gender |
   +----+-----------+--------+
   |  2 | William   |      1 |
   |  4 | James     |      1 |
   |  6 | Benjamin  |      1 |
   |  8 | Michael   |      1 |
   |  9 | Charlotte |      1 |
   | 10 | Ethan     |      1 |
   +----+-----------+--------+
   6 rows in set
   ```

* Not equal to (`<>` and `!=`): Not equal to operators include `<>` and `!=`.

   Example 5: Query all rows in the `student` table where `gender` values are not equal to `1`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, and `gender` columns in these rows.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,gender FROM student WHERE gender <> 1;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+--------+--------+
   | id | name   | gender |
   +----+--------+--------+
   |  1 | Emma   |      0 |
   |  3 | Olivia |      0 |
   |  5 | Sophia |      0 |
   |  7 | Ava    |      0 |
   +----+--------+--------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

* Greater than (`>`) and less than (`<`): The greater than operator (`>`) and the less than operator (`<`) compare numbers based on their values. If characters are compared, they are converted into their respective ASCII codes, and then the ASCII codes are compared from left to right.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The greater than or equal to (>=) and less than or equal to (<=) operators operate in a similar manner.  </p>
    </main>

   Example 6: Query all rows in the `student` table where `score` values are less than `90`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, and `score` columns in these rows.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,score FROM student WHERE score < 90;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+-----------+-------+
   | id | name      | score |
   +----+-----------+-------+
   |  1 | Emma      |    85 |
   |  4 | James     |  87.5 |
   |  7 | Ava       |  89.5 |
   |  9 | Charlotte |    88 |
   +----+-----------+-------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

#### Queries with logical conditions

Logical query operators `AND` and `OR` support queries with multiple conditions.

* `AND`: Return data that satisfies both conditions with `AND`.
  
  
   Example 7: Query all rows in the `student` table where `gender` values are equal to `1` and `score` values are less than or equal to `90`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, `gender`, and `score` columns in these rows.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,gender,score FROM student WHERE gender = 1 AND score <= 90;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+-----------+--------+-------+
   | id | name      | gender | score |
   +----+-----------+--------+-------+
   |  4 | James     |      1 |  87.5 |
   |  9 | Charlotte |      1 |    88 |
   +----+-----------+--------+-------+
   2 rows in set
   ```

* `OR`: Return data that satisfies either one of the conditions.

   Example 8: Query all rows in the `student` table where `gender` values are equal to `1` or `score` values are less than `90`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, `gender`, and `score` columns in these rows.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,gender,score FROM student WHERE gender = 1 OR score < 90;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+-----------+--------+-------+
   | id | name      | gender | score |
   +----+-----------+--------+-------+
   |  1 | Emma      |      0 |    85 |
   |  2 | William   |      1 |  90.5 |
   |  4 | James     |      1 |  87.5 |
   |  6 | Benjamin  |      1 |  96.5 |
   |  7 | Ava       |      0 |  89.5 |
   |  8 | Michael   |      1 |  93.5 |
   |  9 | Charlotte |      1 |    88 |
   | 10 | Ethan     |      1 |    92 |
   +----+-----------+--------+-------+
   8 rows in set
   ```

#### Fuzzy queries (LIKE)

The predicate `LIKE` can be used for string matching.

The syntax means finding data that matches the corresponding column value with the `pattern`. The `pattern` can be a complete string or contain wildcards `%` and `_`, where:

* The underscore (`_`) exactly matches any character in the value.

* The percent sign (`%`) matches zero or multiple characters in the value. The pattern `%` cannot match `NULL`.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>If the database character set uses ASCII, one Chinese character requires two underscores (<code>_</code>); if the database character set uses GBK, one Chinese character requires only one underscore (<code>_</code>). </p>
</main>

Example 9: Query all rows in the `student` table where `name` values contain `am`, and return the data from the `id` and `name` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id,name FROM student WHERE name LIKE '%am%';
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
|  2 | William  |
|  4 | James    |
|  6 | Benjamin |
+----+----------+
3 rows in set
```

#### Range queries (BETWEEN AND)

The `BETWEEN AND` operator selects data between two values. These values can be numerals, literals, or dates.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>Do not swap the two boundary values of a range query. The left boundary value should be greater than or equal to the starting point, and the right boundary value should be less than or equal to the ending point.</p>
</main>

Example 10: Query all rows in the `student` table where `score` values range from 85 to 90, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, and `score` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id,name,score FROM student WHERE score BETWEEN 85 AND 90;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+-------+
| id | name      | score |
+----+-----------+-------+
|  1 | Emma      |    85 |
|  4 | James     |  87.5 |
|  7 | Ava       |  89.5 |
|  9 | Charlotte |    88 |
+----+-----------+-------+
4 rows in set
```

#### Queries with a specified set (IN)

The `IN` operator is used to specify multiple values as a set in a `WHERE` clause. It returns data from the specified column that matches any value in the set. On the other hand, the `NOT IN` operator returns data from the specified column that does not match any value in the set.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>The value in the <code>[NOT] IN</code> set must be of the same type or compatible with each other. </li>
    <li>The values in the <code>[NOT] IN</code> set do not support wildcards. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>

Example 11: Query all rows in the `student` table where `id` values belong to the set of `(1, 3, 5, 7)`, and return the data from the `id` and `name` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id,name FROM student WHERE id IN (1,3,5,7);
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+--------+
| id | name   |
+----+--------+
|  1 | Emma   |
|  3 | Olivia |
|  5 | Sophia |
|  7 | Ava    |
+----+--------+
4 rows in set
```

#### NULL value queries

Due to the inaccurate results obtained when using comparison operators, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN AND`, `IN`, and `NOT IN` to query for `NULL` values, we recommend that you use the dedicated query statements `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` for `NULL` value queries. Additionally, the safe equal operator (`<=>`) can be used to compare both normal values and `NULL` values.

* `IS NULL`: Query for data where the specified column has a `NULL` value.

   Example 12: Query all rows in the `student` table where `score` is NULL, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, and `score` columns in these rows.  

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,score FROM student WHERE score IS NULL;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   Empty set
   ```

* `IS NOT NULL`: Query for data where the specified column has a non-NULL value.

   Example 13: Query all rows in the `student` table where the score is not `NULL`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, and `score` columns in these rows.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,score FROM student WHERE score IS NOT NULL;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+-----------+-------+
   | id | name      | score |
   +----+-----------+-------+
   |  1 | Emma      |    85 |
   |  2 | William   |  90.5 |
   |  3 | Olivia    |  95.5 |
   |  4 | James     |  87.5 |
   |  5 | Sophia    |  91.5 |
   |  6 | Benjamin  |  96.5 |
   |  7 | Ava       |  89.5 |
   |  8 | Michael   |  93.5 |
   |  9 | Charlotte |    88 |
   | 10 | Ethan     |    92 |
   +----+-----------+-------+
   10 rows in set
   ```

### GROUP BY queries

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the query results.

`GROUP BY` supports grouping by a single field or multiple fields. You can also use the `WHERE` clause to filter data before grouping, use the `HAVING` clause to filter data after grouping, and use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort data after grouping.


The following table lists frequently-used aggregate functions in `GROUP BY` queries.

| Aggregate function | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| MAX() | Queries the maximum value of the specified column.  |
| MIN() | Queries the minimum value of the specified column.  |
| COUNT() | Returns the number of rows in the query result.  |
| SUM() | Returns the sum of the specified column.  |
| AVG() | Returns the average value of the data in the specified column.  |

#### Examples

Assume that the `fruit_order` table contains the following data:

```shell
+----------+---------+-----------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | user_id | user_name | fruit_price | order_year |
+----------+---------+-----------+-------------+------------+
|        1 |    1011 | A1        |       13.11 |       2019 |
|        2 |    1022 | B2        |       23.34 |       2019 |
|        3 |    1022 | B2        |       12.22 |       2019 |
|        4 |    1011 | A1        |       22.21 |       2020 |
|        5 |    1033 | C3        |       51.55 |       2020 |
|        6 |    1011 | A1        |       58.83 |       2020 |
|        7 |    1022 | B2        |       14.66 |       2021 |
|        8 |    1022 | B2        |       34.44 |       2021 |
|        9 |    1033 | C3        |       63.66 |       2021 |
+----------+---------+-----------+-------------+------------+
```

* `GROUP BY` query based on a single field

   Example 14: Query the number of orders placed by each customer and return the data of `user_id` and `COUNT(order_id)`.

   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, COUNT(order_id) FROM fruit_order GROUP BY user_id;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +---------+-----------------+
   | user_id | COUNT(order_id) |
   +---------+-----------------+
   |    1011 |               3 |
   |    1022 |               4 |
   |    1033 |               2 |
   +---------+-----------------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

* `GROUP BY` query based on multiple fields

   Example 15: Query the number of orders placed by each customer each year and return the data of `user_id`, `order_year`, and `COUNT(order_id)`.

   ```sql
   SELECT user_id,order_year, COUNT(order_id) FROM fruit_order GROUP BY user_id,order_year;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +---------+------------+-----------------+
   | user_id | order_year | COUNT(order_id) |
   +---------+------------+-----------------+
   |    1011 |       2019 |               1 |
   |    1022 |       2019 |               2 |
   |    1011 |       2020 |               2 |
   |    1033 |       2020 |               1 |
   |    1022 |       2021 |               2 |
   |    1033 |       2021 |               1 |
   +---------+------------+-----------------+
   6 rows in set
   ```

* Filter data before grouping

   Example 16: Query the number of orders placed by each customer in 2020 and return the data of `user_id` and `COUNT(order_id)`.

   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, COUNT(order_id) FROM fruit_order t WHERE t.order_year = 2020 GROUP BY user_id;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +---------+-----------------+
   | user_id | COUNT(order_id) |
   +---------+-----------------+
   |    1011 |               2 |
   |    1033 |               1 |
   +---------+-----------------+
   2 rows in set
   ```

* Filter data after grouping

   Example 17: Query customers who placed two or more orders in 2019 and return the data of `user_id` and `COUNT(order_id)`.

   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, COUNT(order_id) FROM fruit_order t WHERE t.order_year = 2019 GROUP BY user_id HAVING COUNT(order_id)>=2;
   ```

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>When a <code>GROUP BY</code> query includes the <code>HAVING</code> clause, it first obtains the SQL query results without the <code>HAVING</code> clause, and then uses the <code>HAVING</code> condition to filter the data based on these results, and finally returns the filtered data. Therefore, after <code>HAVING</code>, you can use aggregate functions, and these aggregate functions do not have to be the same as the aggregate functions after <code>SELECT</code>. </p>
    </main>

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +---------+-----------------+
   | user_id | COUNT(order_id) |
   +---------+-----------------+
   |    1022 |               2 |
   +---------+-----------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* Sort data after grouping

   Example 18: Query the maximum order amount of each customer and return the data of `user_id` and `MAX(fruit_price)` sorted by maximum order amount in descending order.

   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, MAX(fruit_price) FROM fruit_order t GROUP BY user_id ORDER BY MAX(fruit_price) DESC;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +---------+------------------+
   | user_id | MAX(fruit_price) |
   +---------+------------------+
   |    1033 |            63.66 |
   |    1011 |            58.83 |
   |    1022 |            34.44 |
   +---------+------------------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

### Aggregate queries

For more information about aggregate queries, see [Use aggregate functions in queries](300.use-operators-and-functions-in-query-of-mysql-mode/700.use-aggregate-functions-in-queries-of-mysql-mode.md).

### ORDER BY queries

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the query results in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order based on one or more attribute columns. The default order is ascending.

`ORDER BY` supports sorting by a single field, multiple fields, an alias, or a function. Separate multiple fields with commas (,).

If the `ASC` or `DESC` keyword is not added in an `ORDER BY` query, the query results are sorted in ascending order by default.

#### Examples

Querying data in the `student` table where the `score` value is between 85 and 90.

* Sorting by a single field

   Example 19: Query student information in the `student` table and return the information sorted by `score` in ascending order.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,score FROM student ORDER BY score;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+-----------+-------+
   | id | name      | score |
   +----+-----------+-------+
   |  1 | Emma      |    85 |
   |  4 | James     |  87.5 |
   |  9 | Charlotte |    88 |
   |  7 | Ava       |  89.5 |
   |  2 | William   |  90.5 |
   |  5 | Sophia    |  91.5 |
   | 10 | Ethan     |    92 |
   |  8 | Michael   |  93.5 |
   |  3 | Olivia    |  95.5 |
   |  6 | Benjamin  |  96.5 |
   +----+-----------+-------+
   10 rows in set
   ```

   Example 20: Query student information in the `student` table and return the information sorted by `score` in descending order.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,score FROM student ORDER BY score DESC;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+-----------+-------+
   | id | name      | score |
   +----+-----------+-------+
   |  6 | Benjamin  |  96.5 |
   |  3 | Olivia    |  95.5 |
   |  8 | Michael   |  93.5 |
   | 10 | Ethan     |    92 |
   |  5 | Sophia    |  91.5 |
   |  2 | William   |  90.5 |
   |  7 | Ava       |  89.5 |
   |  9 | Charlotte |    88 |
   |  4 | James     |  87.5 |
   |  1 | Emma      |    85 |
   +----+-----------+-------+
   10 rows in set
   ```

* Sorting by multiple fields

   Example 21: Query student information in the `student` table and return the information sorted by `score` in descending order and by `enrollment_date` in ascending order.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,score,enrollment_date FROM student ORDER BY score DESC,enrollment_date ASC;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
   | id | name      | score | enrollment_date |
   +----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
   |  6 | Benjamin  |  96.5 | 2021-09-01      |
   |  3 | Olivia    |  95.5 | 2021-09-03      |
   |  8 | Michael   |  93.5 | 2021-09-08      |
   | 10 | Ethan     |    92 | 2021-09-01      |
   |  5 | Sophia    |  91.5 | 2021-09-05      |
   |  2 | William   |  90.5 | 2021-09-02      |
   |  7 | Ava       |  89.5 | 2021-09-06      |
   |  9 | Charlotte |    88 | 2021-09-06      |
   |  4 | James     |  87.5 | 2021-09-03      |
   |  1 | Emma      |    85 | 2021-09-01      |
   +----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
   10 rows in set
   ```

* Sorting by using functions

   Example 22: Query student information in the `student` table and return the information sorted by `score` in descending order and by `DAY(enrollment_date)` in ascending order.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,score,enrollment_date FROM student ORDER BY score DESC,DAY(enrollment_date) ASC;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
   | id | name      | score | enrollment_date |
   +----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
   |  6 | Benjamin  |  96.5 | 2021-09-01      |
   |  3 | Olivia    |  95.5 | 2021-09-03      |
   |  8 | Michael   |  93.5 | 2021-09-08      |
   | 10 | Ethan     |    92 | 2021-09-01      |
   |  5 | Sophia    |  91.5 | 2021-09-05      |
   |  2 | William   |  90.5 | 2021-09-02      |
   |  7 | Ava       |  89.5 | 2021-09-06      |
   |  9 | Charlotte |    88 | 2021-09-06      |
   |  4 | James     |  87.5 | 2021-09-03      |
   |  1 | Emma      |    85 | 2021-09-01      |
   +----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
   10 rows in set
   ```

* Sorting after the `WHERE` clause

   Use the `WHERE` clause to filter data before sorting.

   Example 22: Query information about students whose `score` values are greater than `85` in the `student` table and return the information sorted by `DAY(enrollment_date)` in ascending order.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,score,DAY(enrollment_date) FROM student WHERE score > 85 ORDER BY DAY(enrollment_date) ASC;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+-----------+-------+----------------------+
   | id | name      | score | DAY(enrollment_date) |
   +----+-----------+-------+----------------------+
   |  6 | Benjamin  |  96.5 |                    1 |
   | 10 | Ethan     |    92 |                    1 |
   |  2 | William   |  90.5 |                    2 |
   |  3 | Olivia    |  95.5 |                    3 |
   |  4 | James     |  87.5 |                    3 |
   |  5 | Sophia    |  91.5 |                    5 |
   |  7 | Ava       |  89.5 |                    6 |
   |  9 | Charlotte |    88 |                    6 |
   |  8 | Michael   |  93.5 |                    8 |
   +----+-----------+-------+----------------------+
   9 rows in set
   ```

### Limit the number of query results

The `LIMIT` clause can be used to limit the number of rows returned by a `SELECT` query, and is commonly used for pagination operations.

The syntax of the SQL queries that include the `LIMIT` clause is as follows:

```sql
LIMIT [offset,] count_num
```

where

* `offset` specifies the number of rows to skip. It is optional. The default value of `offset` is 0, which specifies to skip zero rows. The value range is \[0,+∞).

* `count_num` specifies the number of rows to retrieve after the rows specified by `offset` are skipped. The value range is \[0,+∞).

* The values of `offset` and `count_num` cannot be specified by using expressions, and can be set only to numbers.

* The number following `LIMIT` cannot be negative.

#### Queries that use LIMIT n, m

* Retrieve the first m rows of records

   Example 23: Query the first five records of the `id` and `name` columns in the `student` table.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name FROM student LIMIT 5;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+---------+
   | id | name    |
   +----+---------+
   |  1 | Emma    |
   |  2 | William |
   |  3 | Olivia  |
   |  4 | James   |
   |  5 | Sophia  |
   +----+---------+
   5 rows in set
   ```

* Retrieve the m rows of records after skipping n rows

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>When the number of remaining rows after skipping n rows is less than m, the query result will include all the remaining data.</p>
    </main>

   Example 23: Query the three rows of the `id` and `name` columns after the third row in the `student` table.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name FROM student LIMIT 3,3;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+----------+
   | id | name     |
   +----+----------+
   |  4 | James    |
   |  5 | Sophia   |
   |  6 | Benjamin |
   +----+----------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

* Retrieve the row with the maximum value

   Example 24: To retrieve the row with the maximum `score` value in the `student` table, you can sort data in the table by `score` in descending order and then retrieve the first row.

   ```sql
   SELECT id,name,score FROM student ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----+----------+-------+
   | id | name     | score |
   +----+----------+-------+
   |  6 | Benjamin |  96.5 |
   +----+----------+-------+
   1 row in set
   ```

#### Paging queries

The `LIMIT` clause can be used based on the logic of paging queries.

The SQL syntax is as follows:

```sql
LIMIT (page_no - 1) * page_size, page_size;
```

where

* `page_no` specifies the page number that starts from 1. The value range is \[1,+∞).

* `page_size` specifies the number of records per page. The value range is \[1,+∞). For example, if `page_no` is set to 5 and `page_size` is set to 10, the 10 records on page 5 are retrieved.

Example 25: In the `student` table, set `page_size` to 2 to retrieve data of page 1, page 2, and page 3.

Page 1:

```sql
SELECT id,name FROM student ORDER BY id LIMIT 0,2;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+---------+
| id | name    |
+----+---------+
|  1 | Emma    |
|  2 | William |
+----+---------+
2 rows in set
```

Page 2:

```sql
SELECT id,name FROM student ORDER BY id LIMIT 2,2;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+--------+
| id | name   |
+----+--------+
|  3 | Olivia |
|  4 | James  |
+----+--------+
2 rows in set
```

Page 3:

```sql
SELECT id,name FROM student ORDER BY id LIMIT 4,2;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
|  5 | Sophia   |
|  6 | Benjamin |
+----+----------+
2 rows in set
```
