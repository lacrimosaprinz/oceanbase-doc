# RIGHT JOIN queries

A RIGHT JOIN query is a RIGHT OUTER JOIN query that returns all records in the right-side table and the matching records in the left-side table.

## Background information

An OUTER JOIN query uses a comparison operator to compare the data in two tables. The join results include the rows that meet the join conditions and those do not meet the join conditions.

OUTER JOIN queries include FULL JOIN queries, LEFT JOIN queries, and RIGHT JOIN queries. An OUTER JOIN query returns all the rows that meet the join conditions. In addition, it returns unused rows of one table and fills `NULL` in the corresponding positions in the other table.

This topic describes how to use RIGHT JOIN queries. For more information about FULL JOIN queries and LEFT JOIN queries, see [FULL JOIN queries](200.full-join-of-mysql-mode.md) and [LEFT JOIN queries](300.left-join-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Syntax

Generally, an `OUTER JOIN` statement contains a left-side table and a right-side table. The leftmost table in the `JOIN` clause is the left-side table, and the rightmost table in the `JOIN` clause is the right-side table.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM table_name1 RIGHT JOIN table_name2 ON join_condition
[ WHERE query_condition ]
[ ORDER BY column_list ];
```

Here, `table_name1` is the left-side table and `table_name2` is the right-side table.


## Examples

Create a table and insert proper data into the table.

```sql
obclient [info]> CREATE TABLE tbl_a(id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [info]> CREATE TABLE tbl_b(number INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, value INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [info]> INSERT INTO tbl_a VALUES(1,'ab'),(2,'cd'),(3,'ef'),(4,'gh');
Query OK, 6 rows affected
Records: 6  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

obclient [info]> INSERT INTO tbl_b VALUES(1,1001),(3,1003),(5,1005);
Query OK, 4 rows affected
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

### Simple RIGHT JOIN queries

To use a `JOIN` clause to return data that meets the join and filter conditions and also to return data from the right-side table that meets the filter condition specified for the right-side table but does not meet the join condition, you can use `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`, or `RIGHT JOIN` for short. In a `RIGHT JOIN` query, the rows in the right-side table matching no rows in the left-side table are returned with the `NULL` value.

Example 1: Execute a `RIGHT JOIN` query on tables `tbl_a` and `tbl_b` and obtain the returned results.

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a;
+------+------+
| id   | name |
+------+------+
|    1 | ab   |
|    2 | cd   |
|    3 | ef   |
|    4 | gh   |
+------+------+
4 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_b;
+--------+-------+
| number | value |
+--------+-------+
|      1 |  1001 |
|      3 |  1003 |
|      5 |  1005 |
+--------+-------+
3 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a RIGHT JOIN tbl_b ON tbl_a.id=tbl_b.number;
+------+------+--------+-------+
| id   | name | number | value |
+------+------+--------+-------+
|    1 | ab   |      1 |  1001 |
|    3 | ef   |      3 |  1003 |
| NULL | NULL |      5 |  1005 |
+------+------+--------+-------+
3 rows in set
```

### RIGHT JOIN queries with a WHERE clause

You can use a `RIGHT JOIN` query to obtain the join result and then use the `WHERE` clause to filter the result.

Example 2: Execute a `RIGHT JOIN` query on the `tbl_a` and `tbl_b` tables and return the data that meets the `value=1003` condition in the `tbl_b` table.

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a;
+------+------+
| id   | name |
+------+------+
|    1 | ab   |
|    2 | cd   |
|    3 | ef   |
|    4 | gh   |
+------+------+
4 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_b;
+--------+-------+
| number | value |
+--------+-------+
|      1 |  1001 |
|      3 |  1003 |
|      5 |  1005 |
+--------+-------+
3 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a RIGHT JOIN tbl_b ON tbl_a.id=tbl_b.number WHERE tbl_b.value=1003;
+------+------+--------+-------+
| id   | name | number | value |
+------+------+--------+-------+
|    3 | ef   |      3 |  1003 |
+------+------+--------+-------+
1 row in set
```
