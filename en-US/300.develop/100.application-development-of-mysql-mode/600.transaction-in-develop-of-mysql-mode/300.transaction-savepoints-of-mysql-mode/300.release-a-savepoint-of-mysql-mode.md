# Release a savepoint

You can release a savepoint that is no longer needed.

## Prerequisites

Savepoints are marked. For more information, see [Mark a savepoint](../300.transaction-savepoints-of-mysql-mode/100.mark-a-savepoint-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Release a savepoint

Execute the following statement to release a savepoint:

```sql
RELEASE SAVEPOINT pointname;
```

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>After the <code>RELEASE SAVEPOINT</code> statement is executed, you cannot roll back the transaction to the released savepoint, or any other savepoints between this statement and this savepoint. </p>
  </main>

In the following example, after the `ru` savepoint is released, you cannot roll back the transaction to the `ru` savepoint or any other savepoints between the `RELEASE SAVEPOINT` statement and the `ru` savepoint.

1. Start a transaction and mark several savepoints.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> SET SESSION autocommit=0;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient [test]> BEGIN;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient [test]> SELECT * FROM ordr;
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   | id | name | value | gmt_create          |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
   |  2 | US   | 10002 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
   |  3 | EN   | 10003 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
   |  4 | JP   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 14:51:44 |
   |  5 | CN   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 14:53:56 |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   5 rows in set

   obclient [test]> INSERT INTO ordr(id, name) VALUES(6,'FR');
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient [test]> SAVEPOINT fr;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient [test]> INSERT INTO ordr(id, name) VALUES(7,'RU');
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient [test]>  SAVEPOINT ru;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient [test]> INSERT INTO ordr(id, name) VALUES(8,'CA');
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient [test]> SAVEPOINT ca;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. View the data in the table.

   Before you commit the transaction, you can view all uncommitted data in the transaction.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> SELECT * FROM ordr;
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   | id | name | value | gmt_create          |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   |  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
   |  2 | US   | 10002 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
   |  3 | EN   |  1003 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
   |  4 | JP   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 14:51:44 |
   |  5 | CN   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 14:53:56 |
   |  6 | FR   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 15:01:39 |
   |  7 | RU   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 15:01:50 |
   |  8 | CA   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 15:02:15 |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   8 rows in set
   ```

3. Release the `ru` savepoint.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> RELEASE SAVEPOINT ru;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

4. Try to roll back to the `ru` and `ca` savepoints. The system returns an error indicating that the savepoints do not exist.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> rollback to savepoint ru;
   ERROR 1305 (42000): savepoint does not exist

   obclient [test]> rollback to savepoint ca;
   ERROR 1305 (42000): savepoint does not exist
   ```
