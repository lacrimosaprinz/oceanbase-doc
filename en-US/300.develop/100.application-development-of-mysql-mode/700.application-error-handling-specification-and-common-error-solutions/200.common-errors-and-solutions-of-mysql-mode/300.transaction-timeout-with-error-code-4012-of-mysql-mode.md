# Transaction timed out, with ERROR 4012 reported

This topic describes how to handle `ERROR 4012`, where an uncommitted transaction timed out in the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database.

## Symptom

If a transaction remains uncommitted for a long period of time after it is started, an error is reported when you query table data.

```sql
obclient [test]> BEGIN;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [test]> SELECT * FROM ordr;
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
| id | name | value | gmt_create          |
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
|  1 | CN   |  NULL | 2022-04-02 14:03:31 |
|  2 | UK   |  NULL | 2022-04-02 14:03:31 |
|  3 | US   |  NULL | 2022-03-31 17:04:55 |
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
3 rows in set

/* Do not perform any operation for a long period of time. */

obclient [test] SELECT * FROM ordr;
ERROR 4012 (25000): Transaction timeout occurred, please rollback the transaction, set the variable ob_trx_timeout to a larger value and then restart the transaction
```

The error codes corresponding to this error message are as follows:

* Error code: ERROR 4012

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 6210

* Error code compatible with MySQL Database: 4012

For more information about the error codes, see [Overview of error messages](../../../../700.reference/900.error-code/600.error-code-of-mysql-mode/100.use-error-information-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Possible causes

The uncommitted transaction timeout indicates that the transaction remains uncommitted after the specified threshold has elapsed. If the transaction is not committed when the specified time has elapsed, the system reports an error. The uncommitted transaction timeout period is controlled by the `ob_trx_timeout` tenant variable. The default value is 86400000000 microseconds, namely 24 hours.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>OceanBase Database provides two timeout mechanisms to prevent transactions from holding locks for a long time and affecting other sessions: idle transaction timeout and uncommitted transaction timeout. Typically, only one timeout mechanism is triggered at a time. </p>
</main>

## Troubleshooting procedure

Take the following steps to view and modify the corresponding tenant variable, roll back the transaction by using `ROLLBACK`, and then proceed with your operations.

1. Check whether the transaction is not committed within the period of time specified by the `ob_trx_timeout` tenant variable.

   The uncommitted transaction timeout period is controlled by the `ob_trx_timeout` tenant variable in the unit of microseconds. We recommend that you use the default value of 86400000000 microseconds, namely 24 hours.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The following variable setting method takes effect only for the current session. To make the settings permanent, use the <code>SET GLOBAL</code> syntax to configure the variable, and then restart the session for the settings to take effect. </p>
   </main>

   ```sql
   obclient> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'ob_trx_timeout';
   +----------------+-----------+
   | Variable_name  | Value     |
   +----------------+-----------+
   | ob_trx_timeout | 100000000 |
   +----------------+-----------+
   1 row in set

   obclient [test]> SET SESSION ob_trx_timeout=86400000000;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. Use the `ROLLBACK` statement to roll back the transaction.

   ```sql
   obclient> ROLLBACK;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. Execute the `COMMIT` statement to commit the transaction.

   ```sql
   obclient> COMMIT;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

4. Query the data in the `ordr` table again. The query succeeds.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> SELECT * FROM ordr;
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   | id | name | value | gmt_create          |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   |  1 | CN   |  NULL | 2022-04-02 14:03:31 |
   |  2 | UK   |  NULL | 2022-04-02 14:03:31 |
   |  3 | US   |  NULL | 2022-03-31 17:04:55 |
   +----+------+-------+---------------------+
   3 rows in set
   ```
