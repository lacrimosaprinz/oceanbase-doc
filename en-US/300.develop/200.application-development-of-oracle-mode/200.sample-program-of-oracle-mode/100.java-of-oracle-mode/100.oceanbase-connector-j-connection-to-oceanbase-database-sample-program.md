  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The procedures provided in this topic are for compiling and running the project using Eclipse IDE for Java Developers 2022-03 under the Windows environment. If you are using a different operating system environment or compiler, the procedures may be slightly different.</p>
</main>

1. Obtain the URL of OceanBase Database. 
2. Obtain the code of the `java-oceanbase-jdbc` project. 
3. Import the `java-oceanbase-jdbc` project to Eclipse. 
4. Modify the database connection information in the `java-oceanbase-jdbc` project. 
5. Run the `java-oceanbase-jdbc` project. 

### Step 1: Obtain the URL of OceanBase Database

1. Contact the OceanBase Database deployment personnel or administrator to obtain the database connection string.

    **Example:**

    ```shell
    obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2883 -usys@oracel001#cluster_name -p******
    ```

    For more information about connection strings, see [Connect to an OceanBase Database tenant by using OBClient](../../100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-oracle-mode/200.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-oracle-mode.md).

2. Fill in the corresponding information of the URL below based on the OceanBase Database connection string. 
 
   The URL used to connect to OceanBase Database in Oracle mode is similar to the following example:

    ```shell
    jdbc:oceanbase://host:port/schema_name?user=$user_name&password=$password
    ```

    **Parameters:**
  
    * `host`: the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), this parameter is the IP address of the ODP. For direct connection, this parameter is the IP address of an OBServer node. 
    * `port`: the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed. 
    * `schema_name`: the name of the schema to be accessed. 
    * `user_name`: the tenant account. For connection through ODP, two account formats are supported: `Username@Tenant name#Cluster name` and `Cluster name:Tenant name:Username`. For direct connection, the `Username@Tenant name` format is supported. 
    * `password`: the account password. 

    For more information about URL parameters, see [Database URL](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-connector-j-en-10000000000911660).

         <version>2.4.2</version>
       </dependency>
     </dependencies>
   ```

#### Code in the InsertAndSelectExample.java file

The `InsertAndSelectExample.java` file is a part of the sample program and contains a sample class `InsertAndSelectExample` for demonstrating how to insert and query data. 

Code in the `InsertAndSelectExample.java` file contains the following parts:

1. Define the package and import `java.sql` interfaces and classes. 

   Declare the name of the parent package of the file to be `com.oceanbase.example`. 

   Import the following interfaces and classes from the `java.sql` package:

   * `Connection` interface: indicates a connection to a database. 
   * `DriverManager` class: provides a set of static methods for managing registration of the JDBC driver and obtaining a database connection. The most common method is `getConnection()`, which is used to create a connection to a database. 
   * `PreparedStatement` interface: indicates a precompiled SQL statement. 
   * `ResultSet` interface: indicates a query result set. 
   * `SQLException` class: indicates exceptions that may occur when you use JDBC to connect to a database, such as connection failure and SQL statement execution failure. 
   * `Statement` interface: indicates a statement in a database. 

   The code is as follows:

   ```java
   package com.oceanbase.example;
   
   import java.sql.Connection;
   import java.sql.DriverManager;
   import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
   import java.sql.ResultSet;
   import java.sql.SQLException;
   import java.sql.Statement;
   ```

2. Define the class name and `main` method. 

   Set the class name to `InsertAndSelectExample`. The name must be the same as the file name. 

   Set the `main` method to `public static void`, a public static method that accepts a string array `args` as parameters. `throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException` is used to declare that the `ClassNotFoundException` and `SQLException` exceptions can be thrown from the method. The caller of the method that throws exceptions is required to handle the exceptions. 

   The code is as follows:

   ```java
   public class InsertAndSelectExample {
   
       public static void main(String[] args) throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException {
           // to do:
           // 3.connect to your database
           // 4.create a table
           // 5.insert records
           // 6.fetch all records
           // 7.release all resources
       }
   }
   ```

3. Connect to a database and obtain the database connection object. 

   Define the URL with additional connection properties required for connecting to OceanBase Database. In the URL:

   * `jdbc:oceanbase`: specifies to use the OceanBase JDBC driver to connect to the database. 
   * `host:port`: the IP address and port number of OceanBase Database. 
   * `opt1=val1&opt2=val2...`: additional connection properties, or URL parameters. 
   * `schema_name`: the name of the schema to be accessed. 
   * `String user = "user_name"`: the username required for logging on to the database. 
   * `String password = "******"`: the password required for logging on to the database. 

   Obtain the database connection object as follows:

   * Load the driver class named `com.oceanbase.jdbc.Driver` by calling the `forName` method of `Class`. 
   * Obtain the `Connection` object named `conn` by calling the `getConnection` method of the `DriverManager` class. 

   The code is as follows:

   ```java
   String url = "jdbc:oceanbase://host:port/schema_name?[opt1=val1&opt2=val2...]";
   String user = "user_name";
   String password = "******";
   Class.forName("com.oceanbase.jdbc.Driver");
   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
   ```

4. Create a table. 

   Create a table named `person` with the `name` and `age` columns. If the table already exists, drop the existing one and then create a new one. Perform the following steps:

   1. Create a `Statement` object named `stmt` to send SQL statements to the database. 
   2. Call the `execute` method of the `stmt` object to execute the SQL statement `drop table person` to drop a table named `person`. Whether the `person` table already exists cannot be determined. Therefore, the `try-catch` structure is used to capture exceptions, to avoid a program crash caused by an attempt to drop a nonexistent table. 
   3. Call the `execute` method of the `stmt` object again to execute the SQL statement `create table person (name varchar(50), age int)` to create a table named `person` with the `name` and `age` columns. The data type of the `name` column is `varchar(50)`, and that of the `age` column is `int`. 

   The code is as follows:

   ```java
   Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
       try {stmt.execute("drop table person");} 
       catch (Exception ignore) {}
           stmt.execute("create table person (name varchar(50), age int)");
   ```

5. Insert data into the table. 

   Call the `PreparedStatement` interface to insert two data records into the `person` table in the database. Perform the following steps:

   1. Create a `PreparedStatement` object named `ps` to execute an SQL statement. The SQL statement is `insert into person values(?, ?)` where `?` is a placeholder that indicates a value to be inserted. 
   2. Call the `setString()` method to set the first placeholder to `Adam`. 
   3. Call the `setInt()` method to set the second placeholder to `28`. 
   4. Execute an update to insert the first data record into the table. 
   5. Call the `setString()` method again to set the first placeholder to `Eve`. 
   6. Call the `setInt()` method again to set the second placeholder to `26`. 
   7. Execute an update again to insert the second data record into the table. 

   The code is as follows:

   ```java
   PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("insert into person values(?, ?)");
       ps.setString(1, "Adam");
       ps.setInt(2, 28);
       ps.executeUpdate();
       ps.setString(1, "Eve");
       ps.setInt(2, 26);
       ps.executeUpdate();
   ```

6. Obtain all data records. 

   Query all data from the `person` table, and return the results to the console. Perform the following steps:

   1. Create a `PreparedStatement` object named `ps` to execute an SQL statement. The SQL statement is `select * from person`, which indicates to query all data from the `person` table. Call the `setFetchDirection()` method to set the cursor in the result set to move forward, and call the `setConcurrency()` method to set the result set to be read-only. 
   2. Perform a query operation, save the query results to the `ResultSet` object, and name the `ResultSet` object `rs`. 
   3. Use the `while` loop to traverse the `ResultSet` object, and call the `rs.next()` method to move the cursor to the next row of data. `true` is returned if there is more data. 
      In the loop, call the `rs.getString(1)` method to obtain the values of the first column (namely, the `name` column in the `person` table), call the `rs.getInt(2)` method to obtain the values of the second column (namely, the `age` column), and return the values to the console in the format of `name is age years old.` 
   4. After the loop ends, close the `ResultSet` and `PreparedStatement` objects. 

   The code is as follows:

   ```java
   ps = conn.prepareStatement("select * from person", ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
   ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
   while (rs.next()) {
       System.out.println(rs.getString(1) + " is " + rs.getInt(2) + " years old.");
       }
   ```

7. Release database resources. 

   Close the `PreparedStatement`, `Statement`, and `Connection` objects to release database resources. This avoids resource consumption and performance issues. 

   The code is as follows:

   ```java
   ps.close();
   stmt.close();
   conn.close();
   ```

    </main>

   ![PE](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/3.develop/4PE.png)

5. View the project. 

   ![pe1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/3.develop/5.0%E7%9B%AE%E5%BD%95.png)

### Step 4: Modify the database connection information in the java-oceanbase-jdbc project

Modify the database connection information in the `InsertAndSelectExample.java` file based on the information obtained in **Step 1: Obtain the URL of OceanBase Database**. 

For example:

* The IP address of the OBServer node is `10.10.10.1`. 
* The access port is 2881. 
* The name of the schema to be accessed is `sys`. 
* The connection account of the tenant is `sys@oracle001`. Here, `oracle001` is a user tenant created in the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database, and `sys` is the username of the `oracle001` tenant.
* The password is `******`. 

The sample code is as follows:

```java
String url = "jdbc:oceanbase://10.10.10.1:2881/sys?socketTimeout=7200000&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useCursorFetch=true&defaultFetchSize=100&useSSL=false&rewriteBatchedStatements=true&cachePrepStmts=true&useServerPrepStmts=true&usePieceData=true&allowSendParamTypes=true";
String user = "root@oracle001";
String password = "******";
```
