### Step 3: Configure a data source

1. Obtain the database connection information.

   Contact the deployment personnel or administrator of OceanBase Database to obtain the database connection string.

   **Here is an example:**

   ```shell
   obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -usys@oracle001 -p******
   ```

   where

   * `-h` specifies the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), this parameter is the IP address of an ODP. For direct connection, this parameter is the IP address of an OBServer node.
   * `-P` specifies the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
   * `-u` specifies the tenant account. For connection through ODP, the tenant account can be in the `username@tenant name#cluster name` or `cluster name:tenant name:username` format. For direct connection, the tenant account is in the `username@tenant name` format.
   * `-p` specifies the account password.

   For more information about connection strings, see [Connect to an OceanBase Database tenant by using OBClient](../../100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-oracle-mode/200.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-oracle-mode.md).

2. Check whether the OceanBase Connector/ODBC driver is installed.

   Choose **Control Panel** > **System and Security** > **Administrative Tools** > **ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)** > **Drivers**. The OceanBase Connector/ODBC driver is displayed if it is installed.

## Project code introduction

Click [sqlsugar-oceanbase-odbc](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/3.develop/demo/C%26C%2B%2B/sqlsugar-oceanbase-odbc.zip) to download the project code, which is a compressed file named `sqlsugar-oceanbase-odbc.zip`.

After decompressing it, you will find a folder named `sqlsugar-oceanbase-odbc`. The directory structure is as follows:

```shell
sqlsugar-oceanbase-odbc
├─ Program.cs
├─ sqlsugar-oceanbase-odbc.csproj
└─ sqlsugar-oceanbase-odbc.sln
```

Here is a breakdown of the files and directories:

* `Program.cs`: the main program file of the project, which contains the entry to the project and the source code that defines the data table and implements data table operations.

* `sqlsugar-oceanbase-odbc.csproj`: the main project file in Visual Studio, which defines the configurations, dependencies, and build information of the project.

* `sqlsugar-oceanbase-odbc.sln`: the solution file in Visual Studio, which contains information about the project and its related projects for unified management and build of multiple projects.

### Code in Program.cs

Code in the `Program.cs` file shows how to use SqlSugar to operate OceanBase Database, such as creating tables, inserting data, and querying data. Besides, the `AopEvents` object is used to set the callback function for events such as log execution, which facilitates debugging and troubleshooting.

To configure the `Program.cs` file, perform the following steps:

1. Reference namespaces.

   Use the `using` keyword to reference the `System`, `SqlSugar`, `System.Linq`, `System.Data`, and `System.Data.Odbc` namespaces, so that related data access classes and database operation classes and methods can be referenced.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```c
   using System;
   using SqlSugar;
   using System.Linq;
   using System.Data;
   using System.Data.Odbc;
   ```

2. Define the namespace for placing related classes and methods.

   Define the `GbaseTest` namespace, in which the `Program` and `TestEntity` classes are defined.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```c
   namespace GbaseTest
   {
       internal class Program
       {
           ...
           ...
       }

       public class TestEntity
       {
           ...
           ...
       }
   }
   ```

3. Define the `Program` class that contains the main logic of the program.

   The steps are as follows:

   1. Define a public, static variable `ConnectionString` of the string type to store the database connection string. The variable can be accessed anywhere in the current assembly. `DSN=your_dsn` indicates that an ODBC connection is used and the data source is `your_dsn`.

       <main id="notice" type='notice'>
         <h4>Notice</h4>
         <p>To run the program, replace <code>your_dsn</code> with the name of the data source that you created in <b>Step 3</b>. </p>
       </main>

   2. Define the `Main` method as the entry to the program. It contains the main logic of the program.
      1. Define the `try-catch` block.
         1. Use the `try` keyword to wrap a piece of code that may throw an exception, the `using` statement, and database operations.
         2. Use the `catch` keyword to capture exceptions and handle them.
      2. Finally, output `Program End.` before the program ends.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```c
       internal class Program
       {
           public static string ConnectionString = "DSN=your_dsn";

           static void Main(string[] args)
           {
               try
               {
                   using (...)
                   {
                       // Database operations
                   }
               }
               catch (Exception ex)
               {
                   ...
                   ...
               }

               Console.WriteLine("Program End.");
           }
       }
   ```

4. Define the `using` statement.

   Use `ConnectionConfig` to configure the database connection information and other options, including the database type ODBC, the connection string `ConnectionString`, the primary key type `Attribute`, automatic connection closing, and the callback function for log execution events. Use the `SqlSugarClient` object to perform database operations, including creating tables, inserting data, and querying data. Use the `using` statement to automatically release related resources, including closing the database connection. The steps are as follows:

   1. Create a `SqlSugarClient` object and assign it to the variable named `db`.

   2. Create a connection configuration instance and use the object initializer to initialize its attributes such as `DbType`, `ConnectionString`, `InitKeyType`, `IsAutoCloseConnection`, and `AopEvents`.

      1. Set the database type to ODBC.
      2. Set the connection string to `ConnectionString`.
      3. Set the primary key type to `Attribute`.
      4. Enable automatic connection closing.

      5. Use `AopEvents` to set the callback function for log execution events. Set the implementation logic for the callback function, in which `sql` indicates the executed SQL statement and `p` indicates the list of parameters in the SQL statement. In the implementation logic, the SQL statement and its parameter list are printed to the console.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```c
                   using (SqlSugarClient db = new SqlSugarClient(new ConnectionConfig()
                   {
                       DbType = SqlSugar.DbType.Odbc,
                       ConnectionString = ConnectionString,
                       InitKeyType = InitKeyType.Attribute,
                       IsAutoCloseConnection = true,
                       AopEvents = new AopEvents
                       {
                           OnLogExecuting = (sql, p) =>
                           {
                               Console.WriteLine(sql);
                               Console.WriteLine(string.Join(",", p?.Select(it => it.ParameterName + ":" + it.Value)));
                           }
                       }
                   }))
   ```

5. Perform database operations.

   Call the `SqlSugarClient.Ado.ExecuteCommand` method to execute SQL statements that create tables and insert data, and call the `SqlSugarClient.Ado.SqlQuery` method to query data and traverse query results. Use the `SqlSugarClient` object to conveniently perform database operations, including creating tables, inserting data, and querying data. The steps are as follows:

   1. Output a prompt to indicate that table creation starts.
   2. Execute an SQL statement to create the `test_tbl1` table that contains two columns: `id` and `name`.

   3. Output a prompt to indicate that data insertion starts.
   4. Define the `tableName` variable to store a table name. Assign the `test_tbl1` value to it.
   5. Execute an SQL statement to insert three records into the `test_tbl1` table: `1, 'John'`, `2, 'Jack'`, and `3, 'Amy'`.

   6. Output a prompt to indicate that data query starts.
   7. Execute an SQL statement to query all data in the `test_tbl1` table, and assign the query results to the `data` variable. `TestEntity` is the entity class of the query result.
   8. Output a prompt to indicate that query result traversal starts.
   9. Traverse the query results and assign each record to the `item` variable. Output the `id` and `name` fields for each record.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```c
                   {
                       Console.WriteLine("Create Table:");
                       db.Ado.ExecuteCommand("CREATE TABLE test_tbl1(id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR2(50))");

                       Console.WriteLine("Insert Data:");
                       string tableName = "test_tbl1";
                       int intValue = db.Ado.ExecuteCommand($"INSERT INTO {tableName} (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John'), (2, 'Jack'), (3, 'Amy')");

                       Console.WriteLine("Query Data");
                       var data = db.Ado.SqlQuery<TestEntity>($"SELECT * FROM {tableName}");
                       Console.WriteLine("Query Results:");
                       foreach (var item in data)
                       {
                           Console.WriteLine($"id: {item.id}, name: {item.name}");
                       }
                   }
   ```

6. Use the `catch` keyword to capture exceptions and handle them.

   When exceptions occur in the program, information about the exceptions will be output. The exceptions, once captured, will help debug and locate problems, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the program. The steps are as follows:

   1. Use the `catch` keyword to capture an exception and assign the exception to the `ex` variable, which is an instance of the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses.

   2. Output a prompt to indicate that an exception occurs in the program.

   3. Convert the captured exception object to a string and output the string. The string contains information such as the type, message, and stack trace of the exception.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```c
               catch (Exception ex)
               {
                   Console.WriteLine("Program Exception:");
                   Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
               }
   ```

7. Define the `TestEntity` class.

   Define the `TestEntity` class with two attributes: `id` and `name`, which represent the `id` and `name` fields of an entity object. The steps are as follows:

   1. Define a public class named `TestEntity`.

   2. Define a public integer attribute named `id`, which represents the `id` field of an entity object. This field can be read and set by calling the `get` and `set` methods of the attribute.

   3. Define a public string attribute named `name`, which represents the `name` field of an entity object. This field can be read and set by calling the `get` and `set` methods of the attribute.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```c
       public class TestEntity
       {
           public int id { get; set; }
           public string name { get; set; }
       }
   ```
