# Use the SELECT...FOR UPDATE statement to lock query results

This topic provides specific examples on how to use the `SELECT...FOR UPDATE` statement to lock query results.

OceanBase Database supports multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). By default, a read transaction does not block a write transaction. You can use the `SELECT...FOR UPDATE` statement to lock the objects of the read transaction to block the write transaction.

## Examples

Use the `SELECT...FOR UPDATE` statement to lock query results.

1. Create a table and insert proper data into the table.

   1. Execute the following SQL statement to create a table named `test_tbl1`:

      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE test_tbl1(id number,
         name VARCHAR(18),
         c_date date,
         PRIMARY KEY (id)
         );
      ```

   2. Execute the following SQL statement to insert data into the `test_tbl1` table:

      ```sql
      INSERT INTO test_tbl1 VALUES(1,'A1',date'2019-09-09'),
         (2,'B1',date'2019-06-06'),
         (3,'C1',date'2019-05-05'),
         (4,'D1',date'2020-02-02'),
         (5,'F1',date'2021-01-01');
      ```

   3. Execute the following SQL statement to commit the transaction:

      ```sql
      COMMIT;
      ```

2. In **Session 1**, use the `FOR UPDATE` syntax to query the row where `id` equals `1` in the `test_tbl1` table and add a row lock. Then, all concurrent updates are blocked and pending.

   ```sql
   SELECT name,c_date FROM test_tbl1 WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+-----------+
   | NAME | C_DATE    |
   +------+-----------+
   | A1   | 09-SEP-19 |
   +------+-----------+
   1 row in set
   ```

3. In **Session 2**, execute the following SQL statement to change the `name` value to `A1A1` in the row where `id` equals `1` in the `test_tbl1` table. The SQL statement waits until the `ROLLBACK` or `COMMIT` statement is executed for the transaction in **Session 1**.

   ```sql
   UPDATE test_tbl1 SET name = 'A1A1'  WHERE id = 1;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   ORA-30006: resource busy; acquire with WAIT timeout expired
   ```

4. In **Session 1**, execute the following SQL statement to commit the transaction:

   ```sql
   COMMIT;
   ```

5. In **Session 2**, execute the `UPDATE` statement in **Step 3** again.

   ```sql
   UPDATE test_tbl1 SET name = 'A1A1'  WHERE id = 1;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
   ```

6. In **Session 2**, execute the following SQL statement to commit the transaction:

   ```sql
   COMMIT;
   ```

7. Query the updated data in **Session 1**.

   ```sql
   SELECT name,c_date FROM test_tbl1 WHERE id = 1;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+-----------+
   | NAME | C_DATE    |
   +------+-----------+
   | A1A1 | 09-SEP-19 |
   +------+-----------+
   1 row in set
   ```
