# Use aggregate functions in queries

An aggregate function scans a set of records and then returns a single row. This set of records can be a table or a view, or results of a subquery.

Aggregate functions are usually used with the `GROUP BY` clause to group values based on one or more columns, and return one record for each group.

## Examples

Gather statistics on the sales amount of toy orders.

1. Create a table named `toys_order_ny` and enter order data.

   ```unknow
   obclient> CREATE TABLE toys_order_ny (
              order_id     NUMBER,
              toy_id       NUMBER,
              toy_dealer   VARCHAR2(20),
              toy_price    NUMBER,
              toy_amount   NUMBER
             );
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. Insert data into the `toys_order_ny` table.

   ```unknow
   obclient> INSERT INTO toys_order_ny VALUES ( 1001,1, 'A',53.12,100 ),
             ( 1002,2, 'A',24.8,190 ),( 1003,3, 'A',19.9,330)
              ,( 1004,1, 'B',53.12,50 ),( 1005,2, 'B',24.8,200 ),
             ( 1006,3, 'B',19.9,350 ),( 1007,2, 'A',24.8,100 );
   7 rows in set
   ```

3. Use an aggregate function to gather statistics on the sales amount of toy orders.

   ```unknow
   obclient> SELECT toy_id
             , count(*)                         order_count
             , sum(toy_amount)                  sum_amount
             , round(avg(toy_amount),2)         avg_amount
             , min(toy_amount)                  min_amount
             ,max(toy_amount)                   max_amount
             FROM toys_order_ny GROUP BY toy_id  ORDER BY toy_id;
   +--------+-------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
   | toy_id | order_count | sum_amount | avg_amount | min_amount | max_amount |
   +--------+-------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
   |      1 |           2 |        150 |      75.00 |         50 |        100 |
   |      2 |           3 |        490 |     163.33 |        100 |        200 |
   |      3 |           2 |        680 |     340.00 |        330 |        350 |
   +--------+-------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
   3 rows in set
   ```
