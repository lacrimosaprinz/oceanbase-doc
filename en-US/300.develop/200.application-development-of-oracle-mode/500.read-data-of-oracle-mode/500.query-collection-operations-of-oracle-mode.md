# Set operations

This topic describes how to use the set operators `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `MINUS`.

In the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database, you can use set operators such as `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `MINUS` to combine multiple queries. These set operators have the same priority. If an SQL statement contains multiple set operators, OceanBase Database calculates them from left to right, unless the order of operations is explicitly specified using parentheses.

## Syntax

```sql
select_clause_set_left
{ UNION | UNION ALL | MINUS | INTERSECT}
select_clause_set_right
```

where

* `select_clause_set_left` is the `SELECT` statement that returns the left set used for set calculation.
* `select_clause_set_right` is the `SELECT` statement that returns the right set used for set calculation.
* `UNION` combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements into one set and removes duplicate rows.
* `UNION ALL` combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements into one set without removing duplicate rows.
* `INTERSECT` returns the intersection of the result sets of two `SELECT` statements.
* `MINUS` returns rows in the result set of the first `SELECT` statement that are not contained in the result set of the second `SELECT` statement.

    <p>The Oracle mode of OceanBase Database supports only the <code>MINUS</code> operator and does not support the <code>EXCEPT</code> operator, though they are semantically equivalent. </p>

<p>The set operators can only operate on the result sets of <code>SELECT</code> statements, and the number of columns and data types of the result sets must be the same. </p>

## Examples

Suppose we have test tables `test_tbl1` and `test_tbl2` with the following data:

```shell
obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM test_tbl1;
+------+------+
| ID   | NAME |
+------+------+
|    1 | A1   |
|    2 | A2   |
|    3 | A3   |
|    4 | A4   |
|    5 | A5   |
|    6 | A6   |
+------+------+
6 rows in set

obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM test_tbl2;
+------+------+
| ID   | NAME |
+------+------+
|    1 | A1   |
|    2 | A2   |
|    3 | A3   |
|    7 | A7   |
|    8 | A8   |
|    9 | A9   |
+------+------+
6 rows in set
```

### UNION example

In the following SQL statement, we use `UNION` to combine the result sets of two `SELECT` statements into one set and remove duplicate rows in the merged result set.

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM test_tbl1
UNION
SELECT id, name FROM test_tbl2;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+------+------+
| ID   | NAME |
+------+------+
|    1 | A1   |
|    2 | A2   |
|    3 | A3   |
|    4 | A4   |
|    5 | A5   |
|    6 | A6   |
|    7 | A7   |
|    8 | A8   |
|    9 | A9   |
+------+------+
9 rows in set
```

### UNION ALL example

In the following SQL statement, we use `UNION ALL` to combine the result sets of two `SELECT` statements into one set without removing duplicate rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM test_tbl1
UNION ALL
SELECT id, name FROM test_tbl2;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+------+------+
| ID   | NAME |
+------+------+
|    1 | A1   |
|    2 | A2   |
|    3 | A3   |
|    4 | A4   |
|    5 | A5   |
|    6 | A6   |
|    1 | A1   |
|    2 | A2   |
|    3 | A3   |
|    7 | A7   |
|    8 | A8   |
|    9 | A9   |
+------+------+
12 rows in set
```

### INTERSECT example

In the following SQL statement, we use `INTERSECT` to return the intersection of the result sets of two `SELECT` statements.

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM test_tbl1
INTERSECT
SELECT id, name FROM test_tbl2;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+------+------+
| ID   | NAME |
+------+------+
|    1 | A1   |
|    2 | A2   |
|    3 | A3   |
+------+------+
3 rows in set
```

### MINUS example

In the following SQL statement, we use `MINUS` to return the rows in the result set of the first `SELECT` statement that are not contained in the result set of the second `SELECT` statement.

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM test_tbl1
MINUS
SELECT id, name FROM test_tbl2;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+------+------+
| ID   | NAME |
+------+------+
|    4 | A4   |
|    5 | A5   |
|    6 | A6   |
+------+------+
3 rows in set
```
