# Commit a transaction

Committing a transaction will persist all changes made in the transaction, delete the savepoints, and release all locks held by the transaction.

## Commit a transaction

In OceanBase Database, you can commit transactions explicitly or implicitly. To explicitly commit a transaction, use the `COMMIT` statement or the commit button on a GUI-based client. To implicitly commit a transaction, you do not need to proactively commit it. When `autocommit` is set to 1, after each statement is executed, OceanBase Database will automatically commit the transaction where this statement is executed. A statement is a transaction.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>OceanBase Database issues an implicit <code>COMMIT</code> statement before and after a DDL statement, which also commits a transaction.  </p>
</main>

* If you use the `BEGIN` statement to start a new transaction, you must use the `COMMIT` statement to commit the transaction after you execute a DML statement.

   * Before you commit a transaction, your changes are visible only to the current session and not for other database sessions. These changes are not persisted and therefore not the final result. You can use the `ROLLBACK` statement to roll back the changes.

   * After you commit the transaction, your changes are visible to all database sessions. After your changes are persisted, you cannot roll them back with a `ROLLBACK` statement.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If the repeatable read isolation level is set for the transaction, sessions where the transaction is started cannot query newly committed data. For more information about transaction isolation levels, see <a href="../../../700.reference/100.oceanbase-database-concepts/800.transaction-management/200.transaction-concurrency-and-consistency/400.transaction-isolation-level/200.transaction-isolation-level-of-oracle-mode.md">Transaction isolation levels</a>. </p>
  </main>

* If transactions are started implicitly, namely, `autocommit` is set to `1` to enable the autocommit mode, each SQL statement is a transaction. In this case, you do not need to execute the `COMMIT` statement to commit the SQL statements as one transaction. After the SQL statements are executed, your changes are persisted, and you cannot roll them back with a `ROLLBACK` statement.

### Commit a transaction explicitly

Use `BEGIN` to start a transaction, use `INSERT` to insert data into the `ordr` table, and then use `COMMIT` to commit the transaction.

```sql
obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM ordr;
+----+------+-------+------------+
| ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE |
+----+------+-------+------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10001 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  2 | US   | 10002 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  3 | EN   | 10003 | 03-NOV-22  |
+----+------+-------+------------+
3 rows in set

obclient [SYS]> BEGIN;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [SYS]> INSERT INTO ordr(id,name) VALUES(4,'JP');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient [SYS]> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

Close and then reestablish the session. You will find that the data is inserted and saved.

```sql
obclient [SYS]> exit;

$obclient -h192.168.0.0 -utpcc@obbmsql#obdemo -P2883 -p******

### Commit a transaction implicitly

Set the `autocommit` variable to `1` to enable the autocommit mode.

```sql
obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM ordr;
+----+------+-------+------------+
| ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE |
+----+------+-------+------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10001 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  2 | US   | 10002 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  3 | EN   | 10003 | 03-NOV-22  |
+----+------+-------+------------+
4 rows in set

obclient> SET autocommit=1;
Query OK, 1 row affected

INSERT INTO ordr(id,name) VALUES(4,'JP');
Query OK, 1 row affected
```

Close and then reconnect the session. You will find that the data is inserted and saved.

```sql
obclient [SYS]> exit;
