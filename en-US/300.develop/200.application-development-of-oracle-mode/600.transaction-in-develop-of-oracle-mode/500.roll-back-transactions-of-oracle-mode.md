# Roll back a transaction

This topic describes how to roll back a transaction.

Rolling back a transaction is to revoke all the changes made in the transaction. Before a transaction is committed, you can roll back the entire transaction or roll back the transaction to any savepoint.

## Roll back an entire transaction

Before you commit a transaction, you can use the `ROLLBACK` statement to roll back the entire transaction.

After you roll back an entire transaction, note that:

* All modifications made to the transaction are discarded.

* All savepoints are cleared.

* All locks held by the transaction are released.

The syntax for rolling back an entire transaction is as follows:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

In the following example, `ROLLBACK` is used to revoke all modifications made by the current transaction.

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM ordr;
+----+------+-------+------------+
| ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE |
+----+------+-------+------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10001 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  2 | US   | 10002 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  3 | EN   | 10003 | 03-NOV-22  |
+----+------+-------+------------+
3 rows in set

obclient [SYS]> BEGIN;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [SYS]> INSERT INTO ordr(id, name, value) VALUES(4,'JP',10004);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient [SYS]> INSERT INTO ordr(id, name, value) VALUES(5,'FR',10005),(6,'RU',10006);
Query OK, 2 rows affected
Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM ordr;
+----+------+-------+------------+
| ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE |
+----+------+-------+------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10001 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  2 | US   | 10002 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  3 | EN   | 10003 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  4 | JP   | 10004 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  5 | FR   | 10005 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  6 | RU   | 10006 | 03-NOV-22  |
+----+------+-------+------------+
6 rows in set

obclient> ROLLBACK;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM ordr;
+----+------+-------+------------+
| ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE |
+----+------+-------+------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10001 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  2 | US   | 10002 | 03-NOV-22  |
|  3 | EN   | 10003 | 03-NOV-22  |
+----+------+-------+------------+
3 rows in set
```

In this example, `BEGIN` is used to start a transaction. Before `COMMIT` is used to commit the transaction, all modifications are visible only to the current session, and are not persisted. You can use the `ROLLBACK` statement to roll back the modifications.

## Roll back a transaction to a savepoint

If savepoints are set for a transaction, you can use the `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` statement to roll back the transaction to a savepoint. For more information about transaction savepoints, see [Mark a savepoint](300.transaction-savepoints-of-oracle-mode/100.mark-a-savepoint-of-oracle-mode.md).

After you roll back a transaction to a specific savepoint, note that:

* The transaction does not end.

* Modifications made before the savepoint are retained but those made after it are discarded.

* All savepoints after the specific savepoint are cleared.

* All locks held by the transaction after the savepoint are released.

The syntax for rolling back a transaction to a specific savepoint is as follows:

```sql
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT pointname;
```

Here, `pointname` specifies the name of the transaction savepoint.
