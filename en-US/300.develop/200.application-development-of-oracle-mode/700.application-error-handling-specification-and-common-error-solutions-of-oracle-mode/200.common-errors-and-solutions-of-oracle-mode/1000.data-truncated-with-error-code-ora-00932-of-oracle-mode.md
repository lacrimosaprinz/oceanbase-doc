# Inconsistent data types, with Error ORA-00932 reported

This topic describes how to handle Error `ORA-00932`, where data is truncated while being inserted into the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database.

## Symptom

When data is inserted into the `info` table, an error occurs, indicating that the data was truncated.

```sql
obclient [SYS]> INSERT INTO info VALUES(1970);
ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes
```

The error codes corresponding to this error message are as follows:

* Error code: ORA-00932

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5083

* SQLSTATE: 22000

For more information about the error codes, see [Overview of error codes](../../../../700.reference/900.error-code/700.error-code-of-oracle-mode/100.use-error-information-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Possible causes

The type of the data to be inserted is inconsistent with that of the target column in the table.

## Troubleshooting procedure

Perform the following steps to view the type and length of each field in the current table and insert a valid value.

1. View the schema of the `info` table.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> DESC info;
   +-------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   | FIELD | TYPE | NULL | KEY | DEFAULT | EXTRA |
   +-------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   | C1    | DATE | YES  | NULL | NULL    | NULL  |
   +-------+------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   1 row in set
   ```

2. Insert a valid value based on the field type.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> INSERT INTO info VALUES(date'1970-01-01');
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   ```

3. View the inserted data.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM info;
   +-----------+
   | C1        |
   +-----------+
   | 01-JAN-70 |
   +-----------+
   1 row in set
   ```
