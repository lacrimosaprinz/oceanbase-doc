# Prepare servers

## Deploy an OceanBase cluster by using OCP

The following table describes the minimum configuration requirements of the servers.

| Product | Server quantity | Minimum functional configuration | Minimum performance configuration | Disk type |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------|
| OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT) | 1 <br>You can also use the OCP server as the OAT deployment server. | CPU: 2 cores</br>Memory: 4 GB | N/A | N/A |

This configuration includes resources required for OAT. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>A server configuration of 16 CPU cores and 32 GB of memory does not ensure the stability of OCP.

## Deploy an OceanBase cluster by using the CLI

  <p><ul><li>To ensure high availability and disaster recovery, an OceanBase cluster needs at least three servers, each with an observer process. These processes across different servers work together to provide services. </li><li>After you deploy an OceanBase cluster, you can decide whether to deploy ODP based on your application scenarios and requirements.<ul><li>If your applications require such features of the OceanBase cluster as high availability, load balancing, and connection pool management, you can deploy ODP. ODP effectively solves issues about the number of connections and load balancing in OceanBase clusters and improves the stability and reliability of applications. </li><li>If your applications connect to the OceanBase cluster simply for queries and operations without requirements on high availability, loading balancing, or connection pool management, ODP is not necessary.

## Arbitration server

The following table describes the minimum configuration requirements for the arbitration server when you use three servers to deploy an OceanBase cluster with two replicas and the arbitration service.

| Version | Minimum server specifications | Bandwidth | Remarks |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| V4.1.0.0 | <ul><li>CPU: 2 cores </li><li>Memory: 8 GB </li><li>Disks: at least 5 GB for the clog disk.  | At least 20 Mbit/s input and output data transmission  | Data disks are not required, but you must reserve sufficient disk space for the `log` directory to store log files.  |
| V4.1.0 BP1 and later | <ul><li>CPU: 2 cores </li><li>Memory: 4 GB </li><li>Disks: at least 5 GB for the clog disk.  | At least 20 Mbit/s input and output data transmission  | Data disks are not required, but you must reserve sufficient disk space for the `log` directory to store log files.  |

### Resource planning

The following CPU model is for your reference: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2682 v4 @ 2.50GHz.

Observe the following rules when you plan resources for the arbitration server:

* By default, a server with the minimum specification (2 CPU cores and 4 GB memory) can support 32 user tenants and the sys tenant simultaneously with the arbitration service enabled (2F or 4F, `primary_zone=RANDOM`, `unit_num=1`).

* For every additional 32 single-unit tenants (2F or 4F, `primary_zone=RANDOM`, `unit_num=1`), the resources of the arbitration server need to be increased accordingly by at least 1 CPU core, 1 GB memory, 2 GB log disk space, and 20 Mbit/s network bandwidth.

* When `unit_num=N` (N>1), you can simply take it as N single-unit tenants.

  <p><ul><li> 2F indicates a cluster with two replicas.</li><li> 4F indicates a cluster with four replicas.</li> <li> <code>primary_zone=RANDOM</code>: You can set <code>PRIMARY_ZONE</code> to <code>RANDOM</code> (uppercase), indicating that any zone with the top priority can be randomly taken as the primary zone. </li><li> <code>unit_num=1</code>: The target zone has one unit in the resource pool. </li><li>A single-unit tenant has one unit in a zone. </li></ul>  For more information about <code>primary_zone</code> and <code>unit_num</code>, see <a href="../../../600.manage/200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md">Create a tenant</a>.</p>

### Network latency requirements

The one-way network latency between the arbitration server and an OBServer node of the OceanBase cluster must be less than or equal to 800 ms.
