# Configure servers

This topic describes the hardware and software configuration requirements for servers, including the operating system, BIOS settings, disk mounting, and NIC settings.

## Step 1: Prepare operating systems

### Operating systems for OAT and OCP

The following table lists the operating systems that support OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT) and OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

| Operating system | Supported version | Server architecture |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) | 7.2 and later | x86_64 |
| CentOS | 7.2 and later | x86_64 |
| Alibaba Cloud Linux | 2 and 3 | x86_64 |
| openSUSE | 12SP3 and later | x86_64 |
| Alibaba Cloud Linux | 2 and 3 | AArch64 |
| NeoKylin | 7.6 | AArch64 |
| Huawei EulerOS | 2.0 SP8 | AArch64 |

### Operating systems for OceanBase Database

The following table lists the Linux operating systems that support OceanBase Database.

| Operating system | Version | Server architecture |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Alibaba Cloud Linux | 2 and 3 | x86_64 or AArch64 |
| AnolisOS | 8.6 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| KylinOS | V10 | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| Unity Operating System (UOS) | V20 | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| NFSChina | 4.0 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| Inspur KOS | 5.8 | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux | 7.2 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) or AArch64 (Kunpeng and Phytium) |
| SUSE Enterprise Linux Server | 12SP3 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) |
| Debian | 8.3 and later | x86_64 (including Hygon) |

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Before you use an operating system, configure the network and install a package manager such as YUM and Zypper first. </p>

## Step 2: Configure BIOS for OceanBase Database

### Special settings

* In the Intel x86 architecture, we recommend that you:

   * Disable non-uniform memory access (NUMA).

   * Run the following command to set `vm.swappiness` to `0` in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file.

      ```bash
      [root@xxx /]
      $vi /etc/sysctl.conf
      vm.swappiness = 0
      ```

      Apply the values configured in the `sysctl.conf` configuration file:

      ```bash
      [root@xxx /]
      $sysctl -p    
      ```

* In the AMD or ARM architecture, we recommend that you enable NUMA.

* In the ARM and Hygon architecture, we recommend that you run the following command to set the values of the `kernel.numa_balancing`, `vm.zone_reclaim_mode`, and `vm.swappiness` parameters to `0` in the `/etc/sysctl.conf` configuration file.

   ```bash
   [root@xxx /]
   $vi /etc/sysctl.conf
   kernel.numa_balancing = 0
   vm.zone_reclaim_mode = 0
   vm.swappiness = 0
   ```

   Apply the values configured in the `sysctl.conf` configuration file:

   ```bash
   [root@xxx /]
   $sysctl -p
   ```

### BIOS options to be disabled

* C-State

* P-State

* EIST

* Power saving

### BIOS options to be configured

* Automatic Power on After Power Loss: Always on

* Intel Virtualization Technology: Enable

* Hyper-Threading: Enable

* Hardware prefetcher: Enable

* VT-d: Enable

* SR-IOV: Enable

* Turbo Mode: Enable

* Energy Performance: Maximum Performance

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The methods for modifying the BIOS settings vary among different servers. For specific operation steps, see the operation instructions of your server.</p>
  </main>

## Step 3: Mount disks

* The following table lists the disk mounting points of an OCP server.

   | Mounting point | Size | Description | Disk format |
   |------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|
   | /home | 100 GB to 300 GB | The operation log disk of the components. | Ext4 is recommended. |
   | /data/log1 | 3 to 4 times the memory size | The log disk of the OCP MetaDB. | Ext4 is recommended. |
   | /data/1 | Depends on the size of data to be stored | The data disk of the OCP MetaDB. | Ext4 is recommended. If the size of the data disk is greater than 16 TB, XFS is recommended. |
   | /docker | 200 GB to 500 GB | The docker root directory. | Ext4 is recommended. |

* Mounting point requirements on an OBServer node

   | Mounting point | Size | Description | File system format |
   |------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
   | /home | 100 GB to 300 GB | The operation log disk of the observer process. | Ext4 is recommended. |
   | /data/log1 | 3 to 4 times the memory size | The log disk of the observer process. | Ext4 is recommended. |
   | /data/1 | Depends on the size of data to be stored | The data disk of the observer process. | Ext4 is recommended. If the size of the data disk is greater than 16 TB, XFS is recommended. |

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>We recommend that you allocate at least 50 GB for a root directory and do not separately mount the <code>/opt</code> and <code>/var</code> directories. If you use Logical Volume Manager (LVM), we recommend that you specify the stripe parameters during the creation of directories. Here is an example:</p>
    <p><code>lvcreate -n data -L 3000G obvg --stripes=3 --stripesize=128</code></p>
  </main>

## Step 4: Configure your NICs

We recommend that you configure two 10 Gbit/s NICs for optimal performance.

* You can name the bond mode as bond0 and choose mode1 or mode4. mode4 is recommended. If you use mode4, you must configure 802.3ad for the switch.
* We recommend that you name the NICs as eth0 and eth1.
