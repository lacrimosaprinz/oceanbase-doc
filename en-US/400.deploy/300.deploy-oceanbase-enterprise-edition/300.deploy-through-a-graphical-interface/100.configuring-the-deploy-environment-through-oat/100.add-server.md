# Add a server

This topic describes how to add a server to the resource pool of OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT).

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>This topic uses OAT V4.1.2 as an example. The GUI varies with the OAT version. </p>
</main>

## Prerequisites

You have installed OAT. For more information, see [Deploy OAT](../../200.preparations-before-deploy/400.deploy-oat.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OAT console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Server**. 
   
3. In the upper-right corner of the **Server Management** page, click **Add Server**.

   <!-- ![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/4.deploy/3.deploy-oceanbase-database-enterprise/2%E6%B7%BB%E5%8A%A0%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8.png) -->

4. In the **Add Server** dialog box, specify the basic information.

   <!-- ![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/4.deploy/oat-add-server/1%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF.png) -->

   **The following table describes the parameters.**

   | Parameter | Description |
   |-----------|----------------------|
   | Server IP | The public IP address of the server to be added.  |
   | SSH Port | The SSH port number of the server to be added.  |
   | IDC | The IDC where the server to be added is located.  |
   | Credentials | The access credentials of the server to be added. At present, two types of credentials are supported: (1) username + password and (2) key.  |
   | Description | The description of the server that can help facilitate host management. This parameter is optional. |

5. Toggle on **Initialize configuration**, and specify the parameters.

   <!-- ![4](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/4.deploy/oat-add-server/2%E5%88%9D%E5%A7%8B%E5%8C%96%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE.png) -->

   **The following table describes the parameters.**

   | Parameter | Description |
   |----------|----------------------|
   | Server Usage | The purpose of the server to be added.  |
   | OceanBase OS User | The OS user that installs and runs OBServer and OceanBase services. A custom user is supported.  |
   | Password | The password of the OS user.  |
   | UID:GID | The UID and GID of the OS user.  |
   | Docker Root Directory | The data directory of Docker.  |

   * **Clock Synchronization**: Specifies whether to enable clock synchronization. This parameter is optional and is disabled by default. To enable clock synchronization, you need to specify the following information:

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>The clock sources must be synchronized between the server where the OceanBase cluster is deployed and the server where OCP is deployed. </p>
      </main>

      | Parameter | Description |
      |----------|----------------------|
      | Clock source IP address | The IP address of the clock source.  |
      | minpoll | The minimum interval between time synchronization requests sent from the chrony client to the clock source, in seconds.  |
      | maxpoll | The maximum interval between time synchronization requests sent from the chrony client to the clock source, in seconds.  |
      | maxslewrate | The maximum slew rate for the clock of the chrony client, in parts per million (ppm).  |
      | Use this server as a secondary clock source | After this option is selected, the server can provide services as the clock source before requests from clients on the allowlist are allowed and requests from clients on the blocklist are blocked. This parameter is optional.  |

   * **Automatically Synchronize to OCP**: This parameter is optional and is disabled by default. After you enable this option, you must select an installed OCP. If no OCP is available, this option is disabled. If you enable **Automatically Synchronize to OCP**, OAT automatically calls an API of OCP to synchronize server information to the OCP that you specified during initialization for future use.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p><ul><li>The installed OCPs refer to those available on the page that appears after you choose <strong>Product Services</strong> > <strong>Products</strong> > <strong>OCP</strong> in the OAT console. For more information about how to install OCP, see <a href="../200.deploy-ocp-use-oat/400.deploy-ocp.md">Deploy OCP</a>.</li><li>Before deploying an OceanBase cluster using OCP, it is necessary to add the nodes where the OceanBase cluster will be deployed to the OCP resource pool.</li></ul></p>
      </main>

   * **Disk initialization settings**: To ensure the stability of OceanBase Database and other OceanBase services, we recommend that you configure the directories of the services on independent disks or partitions. If you select the disk initialization option, OAT automatically creates the corresponding volume group (VG) by using a logical volume manager (LVM), and mounts the logical volumes (LVs) of the corresponding size to the specified mounting directories.

      * **Select a disk or partition**: The system automatically identifies unmounted disks. You can select one or more disks to mount.
      * **Mounting Purpose**: Select a mounting purpose. Valid values are **Software Installation Path**, **Data Disk Path**, **Log Disk Path**, and **Docker Root Directory**.
      * **Mounting Point**: Select the mounting path based on the actual situation.
      * **Space (/GB)**: Specify the space size based on the actual situation, in GB.

6. Click **OK**.

   * If disk initialization is enabled, a dialog box that shows the check items will appear after you click **Submit**. If all check items pass, click **OK** to add the server.

   * If disk initialization is disabled, the configurations are directly submitted and the system starts server initialization after you click **Submit**.

Then you can view the new server in the server list. The server is in the **Initializing** state. On the **Server Management** page, you can find the new server and click **View Tasks** in the **Actions** column to view the initialization progress. At the top of the page, you can search for a server by IP address.

If an error is returned for a subtask that does not affect business, you can view the logs and manually mark the subtask as success.

## What to do next

After you successfully add the servers, you can deploy OCP according to your specific requirements.

* [Deploy OCP](../200.deploy-ocp-use-oat/400.deploy-ocp.md)

After you successfully deploy OCP and add servers, you can deploy an OceanBase cluster according to your specific requirements.

* [Deploy a standalone OceanBase database by using OCP](../300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/200.stand-alone-deployment-of-oceanbase-database-use-ocp.md)

* [Deploy a two-replica OceanBase cluster with the arbitration service by using OCP](../300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/300.deploy-the-quorum-high-availability-service-use-ocp.md)

* [Deploy a single-replica OceanBase cluster by using OCP](../300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/400.deploy-single-replica-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp.md)

* [Deploy a three-replica OceanBase cluster by using OCP](../300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/500.deploy-three-oceanbase-replica-clusters-use-ocp.md)
