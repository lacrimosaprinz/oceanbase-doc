# Upload installation packages

Before you install OceanBase products or create components in the OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT) console, you must upload product installation packages (or images) to the OAT server or remotely connect to product images. Therefore, before you use OAT to deploy OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you must first upload the installation packages required by OCP to the OAT server.

This topic describes how to upload installation packages required by OCP to the OAT server.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Upload the installation packages to the OAT server

After you install OAT, you need to upload the installation packages of OCP to the `/oat/data_dir/images` directory.

To deploy OCP, you must upload the OCP Docker image and MetaDB Docker image to the OAT server.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>If you install OAT by using the oat-all-in-one installation package, you only need to upload the OCP Docker image. </p>
</main>

Here is an example:

```shell
[root@hostname /]# scp ./ocp.tar <oat_server>:/oat/data_dir/images/ocp.tar
[root@hostname /]# scp ./meta_xxx.tar <oat_server>:/oat/data_dir/images/meta_xxx.tar
```

In the command, `oat_server` indicates the IP address of the OAT server.

### Step 2: Add the installation package to the OAT service

1. Log on to the OAT console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Systems and Security** > **Installation Package**. On the **Installation Package Management** page, click **Add Image** in the upper-right corner and select **Local Scan**.
