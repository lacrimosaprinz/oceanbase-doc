# Add a server to the resource pool

Before you deploy an OceanBase cluster by using OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you must add the server where the OceanBase cluster is to be deployed to the resource pool of OCP.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>This topic uses OCP V4.1.0 as an example. The GUI varies with the OCP version. </p>
  </main>

## Prerequisites

* You have prepared the servers for deploying an OceanBase cluster, added the servers to OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT), and initialized the servers. For more information, see [Prepare servers](../../200.preparations-before-deploy/100.prepare-servers.md) and [Add a server](../100.configuring-the-deploy-environment-through-oat/100.add-server.md).
* You have deployed OCP. For more information, see [Deploy OCP](../200.deploy-ocp-use-oat/400.deploy-ocp.md).

## Procedure

1. Enter the access URL in the format of `http://<IP address of the OCP server>:8080` in the address bar of your browser and press **Enter**. 
   Then, use the admin account to log on to the OCP console.

     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>Contact OceanBase Technical Support to obtain the default password of the admin account. To ensure account security, change the password upon the first logon. </p>
   </main>

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Hosts**.

3. In the upper-right corner of the page that appears, click **Add Host**.

4. In the dialog box that appears, enter the server information.

   The following table describes the parameters that you need to configure.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |------------|----------------------|
   | **IP Address** | The NIC IP address of the OBServer node added to the resource pool.  |
   | **SSH Port** | The SSH port. Default value: `22`.  |
   | **Host Type** | The label that you specify for hosts with the same configurations to facilitate host management. If the required host type is unavailable, you can click **Create Host Type** to add a host type.  |
   | **IDC** | Select the IDC where the server is deployed. IDC information includes **IDC** and **Region**. <ul><li>An IDC is one of the host attributes that you must record for an OceanBase cluster. The IDC is referenced in OceanBase load balancing and SQL statement routing strategies. Specify the actual IDC. </li><li>A region specifies the geographical area where the host is located. It is one of the host attributes that you must record for an OceanBase cluster. The region affects the OceanBase load balancing and SQL statement routing strategies. Specify the actual region. </li></ul><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>OCP V3.1.1 and later support the multi-zone mode. When you add an IDC, it is created in the zone where the current OCP is deployed. </p></main> |
   | **Host Type** | You can select **Physical Machine**, **Container**, or **ECS**.  |
   | **Credentials** | Select the credentials used to remotely log on to the physical server. You can select **Add Credential** from the drop-down list to create credentials.  |
   | **Host Alias** | A host alias is a label that you specify for hosts with the same configurations. We recommend that you specify a meaningful alias to facilitate host management. This parameter is optional.  |
   | **Description** | The host comments that can be used to facilitate host management. This parameter is optional.  |

5. Click **OK**.

## What to do next

After the server is added, you can use the following methods to deploy the OceanBase cluster:

* [Deploy a standalone OceanBase database by using OCP](../300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/200.stand-alone-deployment-of-oceanbase-database-use-ocp.md)
* [Deploy a two-replica OceanBase cluster with the arbitration service by using OCP](../300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/300.deploy-the-quorum-high-availability-service-use-ocp.md)
* [Deploy a single-replica OceanBase cluster by using OCP](../300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/400.deploy-single-replica-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp.md)
* [Deploy a three-replica OceanBase cluster by using OCP](../300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/500.deploy-three-oceanbase-replica-clusters-use-ocp.md)
