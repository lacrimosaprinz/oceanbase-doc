# Deploy a standalone OceanBase database by using OCP

The standalone mode is a streamlined database architecture of OceanBase Database. Compared with a distributed cluster, a standalone database requires only one host and is easy to deploy and ready to use. However, without multiple replicas and scaling capabilities, a standalone database is only suitable for development, testing, and business systems that do not require high data security.

This topic describes how to deploy a standalone OceanBase database by using OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>This topic uses OCP V4.1.0 as an example. The GUI varies with the OCP version. Only OceanBase Database V4.1.0 and later support this deployment mode. </p>
</main>

## Prerequisites

* You have deployed OCP. For more information, see [Deploy OCP](../200.deploy-ocp-use-oat/400.deploy-ocp.md).
* You have added the server where the OceanBase cluster is to be deployed to the resource pool of OCP. For more information, see [Add a server to the resource pool of OCP](../300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/100.add-observer-machine-to-the-ocp-resource-pool.md).
* You have logged on to the OCP console and have the `CREATE CLUSTER` privilege. For more information, see [Role overview](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-ocp-en-10000000000838707) and [Default OCP roles](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-ocp-en-10000000000838497).
* You have obtained the RPM package of OceanBase Database. For more information, see [Prepare installation packages](../../200.preparations-before-deploy/300.prepare-installation-packages.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3. On the **Clusters** page, click **Create Cluster** in the upper-right corner.

4. On the **Create Cluster** page, click **Standalone Centralized** in the upper-right corner.

5. On the **Create Cluster** page, set the basic information of the cluster.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |-------------------|-----------------|
   | **Cluster Name** | The name of the cluster to be created. The cluster name must be 2 to 48 characters in length and can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_). The cluster name must start with letters.  |
   | **root@sys Password** | This password can be customized or randomly generated. The password must meet the following complexity requirements: </br> <ol><li>Be 8 to 32 characters in length. </li><li>Contain at least two digits, two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, and two special characters. </li></ol>  </br>Supported special characters are <code>\~ ! @ # % \^ \& \* _ - + = \` \| ( ) { } \[ \] : ; ' , . ? /</code> </br>In addition, you can click **Copy Password** to copy a custom or randomly generated password to the clipboard.  |
   | **OceanBase Database Version** | You can select an existing OceanBase Database version from the list or click **Add Version** to upload the RPM package of a required OceanBase Database version.  |
   | **Zone Name** | You can use the default name or define a custom name.  A zone name must consist of 2 to 48 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_), and start with a letter.  |
   | **Host** | Select a host with the same architecture as that of the selected **OceanBase Database version**. You can select only one host to run the OBServer and RootServer. If no host is available in the drop-down list, you can click **Add Host** in the drop-down list to add a host.  |

6. (Optional) On the **Create Cluster** page, specify the cluster parameters.

   You can use the default parameter settings, or turn on **Parameter Settings** to modify cluster parameters.

   * You can add startup parameters one by one and set their values.
   * You can also click **Select Parameter Template** and select a parameter template. The system automatically populates the parameters in this section by using the template. If no cluster parameter template is available, you can click **Create Cluster Template** to create one.

7. (Optional) On the **Create Cluster** page, configure the paths and ports.

   You can use the default path and port settings, or turn on **Custom Settings** to modify parameters in the **Path Settings** and **Port Settings** sections.

   * Configure the paths:

      1. In the **Path Settings** section, specify the **Software Installation Path**, **Data Disk Path**, and **Log Disk Path** as needed.
      2. Click **Test** to check whether the paths can be used. If a path cannot be used, you can perform troubleshooting based on the test results, or use another path.

   * Configure the ports:

      1. In the **Port Settings** section, specify **SQL Port** and **RPC Port** as needed.
      2. Click **Test** to check whether the ports are occupied. If a port is occupied, you must use another port.

8. Click **Submit** in the lower-right corner.

## What to do next

After the cluster is created, you can create user tenants based on your business needs.

* For more information about how to create a user tenant in OCP, see [Create a tenant](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-ocp-en-10000000000838603).
