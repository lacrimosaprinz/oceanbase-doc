# Deploy a two-replica OceanBase cluster with the arbitration service by using OCP

OceanBase Database supports the arbitration service since V4.1. The arbitration service can resolve the issue that the response time increases when a replica in the same region fails in the deployment scenario of three IDCs across two regions. The arbitration service can also reduce the cross-region bandwidth overhead and minimize the costs of the third IDC.

This topic describes how to deploy a two-replica OceanBase cluster with one arbitration member by using OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p><ul><li>This topic uses OCP V4.1.0 as an example. The GUI varies with the OCP version. </li><li>You can add only one arbitration service for an OceanBase cluster. </li></ul></p>
</main>

## Prerequisites

* You have deployed OCP. For more information, see [Deploy OCP](../200.deploy-ocp-use-oat/400.deploy-ocp.md).
* You have added the servers where the OceanBase cluster is to be deployed to the resource pool. For more information, see [Add a server to the resource pool](../300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/100.add-observer-machine-to-the-ocp-resource-pool.md).
* You have logged on to the OCP console and have the `CREATE CLUSTER` privilege. For more information, see [Role overview](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-ocp-en-10000000000838707) and [Default OCP roles](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-ocp-en-10000000000838497).
* You have obtained the RPM package of OceanBase Database V4.1.0 or later. For more information, see [Prepare installation packages](../../200.preparations-before-deploy/300.prepare-installation-packages.md).

## Procedure

### Step 1: Create a two-replica cluster

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3. On the **Clusters** page, click **Create Cluster** in the upper-right corner.

4. On the **Create Cluster** page, use the default value **Distributed Cluster**.

5. On the **Create Cluster** page, configure the basic information of the cluster.

   The following table describes parameters in the **Basic Settings** section.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |-------------------|-----------------|
   | **Cluster Type** | You can select **Primary Cluster** or **Standby Cluster**. In this example, **Primary Cluster** is selected.  |
   | **Cluster Name** | The name of the cluster to be created. The cluster name must be 2 to 48 characters in length and can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_). The cluster name must start with letters.  |
   | **root@sys Password** | This password can be customized or randomly generated. The password must meet the following complexity requirements: </br> <ol><li>Be 8 to 32 characters in length. </li><li>Contain at least two digits, two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, and two special characters. </li></ol>  </br>Supported special characters are <code>\~ ! @ # % \^ \& \* _ - + = \` \| ( ) { } \[ \] : ; ' , . ? /</code> </br>In addition, you can click **Copy Password** to copy a custom or randomly generated password to the clipboard.  |
   | **OceanBase Database Version** | You can select an existing OceanBase Database version from the list or click **Add Version** to upload the RPM package of a required OceanBase Database version.  |

6. On the **Create Cluster** page, configure the deployment mode of the cluster.

   By default, three zones are added. You only need to retain two zones. Delete one zone by clicking the **Delete** icon next to it.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |--------------------|-----------------------------------|
   | **Zone Name** | Generally, a default name is provided. You can set a custom name as needed.  The zone name must be 2 to 48 characters in length and can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_). It must start with a letter.  |
   | **IDC** | The IDC of the zone. Hosts in a zone can be deployed in only the same IDC.  |
   | **Host Type (Optional)** | If you select a host type, the host list displays only the hosts of the specified host type.  |
   | **CPU Architecture** | Choose **Automatic** or **Manual**.  |
   | **Host** | The IP address of the server. You can select multiple IP addresses.  |
   | **Root Server** | You must select an IP address as the host for the RootService. For a multi-replica OceanBase cluster, you must specify a RootService for each zone.  |
   | **Zone Priority Rankings** | (Optional) The zone priorities for leader distribution of the sys tenant in the cluster. If this parameter is not specified, leaders of the sys tenant are preferentially distributed in the first zone. The zone with the highest priority is taken as the primary zone. Only one primary zone is allowed. </br>You can also select this option and customize the zone priorities. To customize the zone priorities, perform the following steps:<ol><li> Select one or more zones from the left-side list.  The list shows all zones available in the cluster. </li><li>Click the closing angle bracket (>) in the middle.<b></b>  The selected zones are moved to the <b>Priority Rankings</b> list. The zones that are selected at the same time have the same priority. </li><li>Repeat the first two steps to add zones of a lower priority. </li><li>To adjust the priority of a zone, drag the zone in the <b>Priority Rankings</b> list to adjust its sequence in the list.  The zones in the list are sorted by priority in descending order. </li></ol> |
