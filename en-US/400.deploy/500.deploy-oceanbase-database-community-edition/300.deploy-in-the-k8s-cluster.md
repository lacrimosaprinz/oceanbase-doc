# Deploy OceanBase Database in a Kubernetes cluster

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Database in a Kubernetes environment by using ob-operator.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- You have an available Kubernetes cluster with at least 2 CPUs, 10 GB of memory, and 100 GB of storage space.
- You have installed cert-manager. For more information about the installation method, see [Installation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).
- You have installed local-path-provisioner and the configured target location has sufficient storage space. For more information about the installation method, see [Installation](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner).

## Deploy ob-operator

Run the following command to deploy ob-operator in the Kubernetes cluster:

- Stable version

  ```shell
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/2.1.0_release/deploy/operator.yaml
  ```

- Development version

  ```shell
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/operator.yaml
  ```

Run the following command to check whether ob-operator is successfully deployed:

```shell
kubectl get pod -n oceanbase-system
```

The expected output is as follows:

```shell
NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
oceanbase-controller-manager-86cfc8f7bf-4hfnj   2/2     Running   0          1m
```

## Deploy the OceanBase cluster

Follow the steps below to deploy the OceanBase cluster in the Kubernetes cluster:

1. Create secrets.
  
   Before creating an OceanBase cluster, you must create the secrets required for specific users. The command for creating secrets is as follows:

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic root-password --from-literal=password='root_password'
    kubectl create secret generic proxyro-password --from-literal=password='proxyro_password'
    kubectl create secret generic monitor-password --from-literal=password='monitor_password'
    kubectl create secret generic operator-password --from-literal=password='operator_password'
    ```

2. Deploy the OceanBase cluster.
      
   Use the following command to deploy the OceanBase cluster in the Kubernetes cluster:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/2.1.0_release/example/quickstart/obcluster.yaml
    ```

    The creation process usually takes about 2 minutes. Use the following command to check the cluster status:

    ```shell
    kubectl get obclusters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com test
    ```

    The expected output is as follows:

    ```shell
    NAME   STATUS    AGE
    test   running   6m2s
    ```

3. Connect to the OceanBase cluster.
    
   Follow the steps below to connect to the newly created OceanBase cluster:
  
    ```shell
    # Use the following command to find the observer's POD IP and POD name.
    # The name of the POD follows the format {cluster_name}-{cluster_id}-{zone}-uuid.
    kubectl get pods -o wide
    # Use the following command to connect to the cluster:
    mysql -h{POD_IP} -P2881 -uroot -p'root_password' oceanbase -A -c
    ```
