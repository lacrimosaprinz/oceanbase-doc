# Clear an OceanBase cluster

If you have deployed an OceanBase cluster on your servers and you want to deploy a new OceanBase cluster, you must clear the old cluster before you deploy the new one. 

This topic describes how to clear an OceanBase cluster by using the CLI. 

  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase clusters that are deployed following the steps of deploying OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. </p>
  </main>

## Considerations

Before you clear the environment of an OceanBase cluster, we recommend that you back up your data. This ensures the integrity and security of your data and provides you a data copy for restore or migration in the future. 

For more information about how to back up data for an OceanBase cluster, see [Preparations for backup](../600.manage/600.backup-and-recovery/400.data-backup/100.preparation-before-data-backup.md). 

## Procedure

### Step 1: Stop and uninstall services

Stop the old observer processes and ensure that they are not running. Then, uninstall the related database software. The procedure is as follows:

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>OceanBase Database becomes unavailable after the observer processes are stopped. Therefore, before you perform the following steps, make sure that the old OceanBase cluster is no longer in use and the data is backed up. Proceed with caution to avoid unexpected data loss or system unavailability. </p>
</main>

1. Run the following command to check whether the observer process exists: 

   ```shell
   ps -ef|grep observer
   ```

2. (Optional) Stop the observer process. 

   If the observer process exists on your server, run the following command to stop the observer process:

   ```shell
   kill -9 `pidof observer`
   ```

3. Run the following command to view the name of the installed RPM package of OceanBase Database: 

   ```shell
   rpm -qa|grep oceanbase
   ```

4. Run the following command to uninstall the RPM package of OceanBase Database: 

   ```shell
   sudo rpm -e $rpm_name
   ```

   Here, `$rpm_name` is the name of the RPM package to be uninstalled. 

   You can run the following command to check whether the RPM package is completely uninstalled. 

   ```shell
   rpm -ql $rpm_name
   ```

5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 until services on all OBServer nodes are stopped and uninstalled. 

### Step 2: Clean up the database files

Remove the obsolete database files, including data files, log files, and other temporary files. 

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>The following operations are irreversible. That is, the deleted files and directories cannot be recovered. Therefore, before you run the following commands, make sure that the data in the directories is backed up or no longer needed. </p>
</main>

1. Run the following command to remove files on the operational log disk of the observer process: 

   ```shell
   sudo rm -rf /home/admin/oceanbase/*
   ```

2. Run the following command to remove files on the log disk of the observer process: 

   ```shell
   sudo rm -rf /data/log1/*
   ```

3. Run the following command to remove files on the data disk of the observer process: 

   ```shell
   sudo rm -rf /data/1/*
   ```

4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 until all database files are removed from all OBServer nodes.
