# Overview

Data migration is a common operation in daily O&M tasks, essential for adjusting cluster load and relocating data centers. While operations such as data archiving within the cluster, data balancing between tables, and migration of resource units can be quickly initiated through simple commands in OceanBase Database, external tools are required for tasks involving heterogeneous data sources and data synchronization between clusters.

This chapter introduces several commonly used data migration methods and tools.

## Application scenarios

Data migration is a common operation in database O&M and is typical in the following scenarios:

* Cluster load adjustment and IDC relocation
* Data export to files and data import from files to databases
* Database replacement
* Database logical replication, including read/write splitting, database disaster recovery, and multi-site high availability
* Business data replication

## Migration plans

OceanBase Database provides various data migration and replication methods, including:
* Migrate data by using OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) (recommended)
* Migrate data by using OBLOADER and OBDUMPER
   * Import data by using OBLOADER
   * Export data by using OBDUMPER
* Migrate data by using SQL scripts
* Migrate data by using MyDumper
* Migrate data by using DataX
* Migrate data by using an OUTFILE statement
* Migrate data by using DBCAT
