# Use mydumper and myloader to migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database

This topic describes how to migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database (MySQL mode) by using mydumper and myloader. 

## Introduction to mydumper and myloader

* **mydumper** is an open-source multi-threaded backup tool designed for MySQL databases. It allows you to back up an entire database, a single table, or multiple tables, and supports multi-threaded backup to accelerate the data backup process. mydumper also supports the compression and encryption of backup data. You can restore data from backup files. mydumper is a command-line tool. To use the tool, you must install it and then operate it through the command line interface (CLI). 

* **myloader** is a tool designed for you to restore data from the backup files created by mydumper. myloader allows you to quickly restore a MySQL database by using the database backup files without creating a database first. It also allows you to restore data to a specified point in time. You can specify the data tables and rows to restore. myloader is a command-line tool. To use the tool, you must install it and then operate it through the command line interface (CLI). 

Both mydumper and myloader are open-source tools that are efficient, secure, reliable, and support various backup methods, data compression, and encryption.

## Procedure

1. Prepare the environment. 
   
2. Perform backup operations. 

   The following example shows how to back up data in the source MySQL database:

   ```shell
   mydumper -h xx.xx.xx.xx -P3306 -u username -p ****** -B test_db -o /data/backup/mysql/
   ```

   The following table describes frequently-used options in the mydumper command.

   | Option | Full name of the option | Description |
   |-----------|-------------------|----------|
   | -h | --host | The name of the host to connect. |
   | -P | --port | The port number used for connection. |
   | -u | --user | The username used for backup. |
   | -p | --password | The user password used for backup. |
   | -B | --database | The name of the database to back up. If not specified, all databases on the connected host are backed up by default. |
   | -T | --tables-list | The list of tables to back up. Separate the table names with commas (,). |
   | -i | --ignore-engines | The list of storage engines to ignore during the backup process. Separate the engine names with commas (,). |
   | -m | --no-schemas | Specifies not to back up table schemas. |
   | -t | --threads | The number of backup threads executed in parallel. Default value: 4. |
   | -c | --compress | Specifies to compress the exported files. |
   | -o | --outputdir | The directory to which the backup files are exported. |

3. Perform restore operations. 

   After the data is backed up, you can run the `source` command or the `myloader` command to restore the data. 

   * Use the `source` command to restore the data. 

      If you cannot directly restore a table, you can find the SQL file of the table, and run the `source` command on the CLI to restore the table.

      ```shell
      source <table name>-schema.sql # Restore the table schema.
      
      source <table name>.sql # Restore the table data.
      ```

   * The following example shows how to restore data in an OceanBase database:

      ```shell
      myloader -h xx.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -u 'user@tenantname#clustenamer' -p ****** -o -d /data/backup/mysql/
      ```

      The following table describes frequently-used options in the myloader command.

      | Option | Full name of the option | Description |
      |-----------|-------------------|----------|
      | -h | --host | The name of the host to connect. |
      | -P | --port | The port number used for connection. |
      | -u | --user | The username used for restore. |
      | -p | --password | The user password used for restore. |
      | -B | --database | The name of the database to restore. |
      | -d | --directory | The directory where the backup files are stored. |
      | -o | --overwrite-tables | Specifies to drop a table first if the table to restore already exists. This parameter takes effect only if you have backed up the table schema. |
      | -B | --database | The name of the database to restore. |

### Step 1: Prepare the environment

1. Download the installation package. 

   Download the installation package from the [download page](https://github.com/mydumper/mydumper/tags) as needed. 

2. Decompress the installation package to the host where the database is deployed. 

   The following example shows how to decompresse the `mydumper-0.12.7-2-zstd.el7.x86_64.rpm` package: 

   ```shell
   rpm2cpio mydumper-0.12.7-2-zstd.el7.x86_64.rpm | cpio -div
   ```

3. Verify the installation. 

   ```shell
   ./usr/bin/mydumper --help
   ```

   The `metadata` file and the corresponding table schema or table data files are generated in the backup destination directory. 

### Step 2: Perform backup operations

#### Back up all databases

```shell
mydumper -h xx.xx.xx.xx -P3306 -u username -p ****** -o /data/backup/mysql/
```

#### Back up the `test` database

```shell
mydumper -h xx.xx.xx.xx -P3306 -u username -p ******  -B test -o /data/backup/mysql/
```

#### Back up tables `t1` and `t2` in the `test` database

```shell
mydumper -h xx.xx.xx.xx -P3306 -u username -p ****** -B test -T t1,t2 -o /data/backup/mysql/
```

#### Back up only the table data of the `t1` table

```shell
mydumper -h xx.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -u 'user@tenantname#clustenamer' -p****** -B test -T t1 -m -o /data/backup/mysql/
```

#### Back up the `t1` table, with parallel threads and data compression enabled

```shell
mydumper -h xx.xx.xx.xx -P3306 -u username -p ****** -B test -T t1 -m -o /data/backup/mysql/
```

### Step 3: Perform restore operations

#### Disable `FOREIGN KEY` constraint check

Statements in the backup table schema may contain `FOREIGN KEY` constraints. When you import the table schema to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, an error occurs if the table referenced by a foreign key does not exist. Therefore, you must disable the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint check before the import. 

```sql
MySQL [oceanbase]> SET GLOBAL foreign_key_checks=off;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

MySQL [oceanbase]> SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE '%foreign%';
+--------------------+-------+
| Variable_name      | Value |
+--------------------+-------+
| foreign_key_checks | OFF   |
+--------------------+-------+
1 row in set
```

After the data is backed up, you can run the `source` command or the `myloader` command to restore the data. 

#### Use the `source` command to restore the data

If you cannot directly restore a table, you can find the SQL file of the table, and run the `source` command on the CLI to restore the table. For example: 

```shell
source test.t1-schema.sql # Restore the table schema.

source test.t1.00000.sql # Restore the table data.
```

#### Use the myloader command to restore the data

* Import the table schema and table data. 

   ```shell
   myloader -h xx.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -u 'user@tenantname#clustenamer' -p ******  -B test -o -d /data/backup/mysql/
   ```

* Import the database. If the database does not exist, a new database is created: 

   ```shell
   myloader -h xx.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -u 'user@tenantname#clustenamer' -p ******  -B test -s test1 -o -d /data/backup/mysql/
   ```
