3. On the **Add Data Source** page, specify the information about the data source.

   * **Deployment Type**: Select **Self-managed Database** or **Alibaba Cloud**.

      * **Alibaba Cloud**: the database instance purchased on Alibaba Cloud.
      * **Self-managed Database**: the database instance that you deployed on your own.

   * **Database Type**: the data source type.

      Add a MySQL data source and an OceanBase data source as the source and destination databases for synchronization.

      * Select **Self-managed Database** for **Deployment Type** and **MySQL** for **Database Type** to add the MySQL database instance that you deployed.

         Settings of the MySQL data source are as follows:

         * **Network Address**: the IP address of the MySQL database.
         * **Authentication Method**: the authentication method. Valid values include **Account and Password**, **Account without Password**, and **No Account and Password**. By default, **Account and Password** is selected.
         * **Account**: the username for logging on to the MySQL database.
         * **Password**: the password corresponding to the username for logging on to the MySQL database.
         * **Description**: the description of the database. Specify a name that is easy to remember and identify, such as transaction database, user database, or test database. This field is optional.

         <!-- ![MySQL](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.0.0/data-migration/CloudCanal/cloudcanal2.2.5.36/2MySQL%E6%BA%90%E5%BA%93.png) -->

      * Select **Self-managed Database** for **Deployment Type** and **OceanBase** for **Database Type** to add the OceanBase database instance that you deployed.

         Settings of the OceanBase data source are as follows:

         * **Network Address**: the IP address for connecting to the OceanBase database directly or by using OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP).
         * **oblogproxy host**: the IP address of oblogproxy. This field is required when an OceanBase database serves as the source database for incremental synchronization. It is optional when an OceanBase database serves as the destination database.
         * **OceanBaseRpcPort**: the RPC port of the OceanBase database. The default value is 2882.
         * **Authentication Method**: the authentication method. Valid values include **Account and Password**, **Account without Password**, and **No Account and Password**. The default value is **Account and Password**.
         * **Account**: the username for logging on to the OceanBase database. If you directly connect to the OceanBase database, the username is in the **Username@Tenant name** format. If you connect to the OceanBase database using ODP, the username is in the **Username@Tenant name#Cluster name** format.
         * **Password**: the password corresponding to the username for logging on to the OceanBase database.
         * **Description**: the description of the database. Specify a name that is easy to remember and identify, such as transaction database, user database, or test database. This field is optional.

4. View the two added data sources.

   <!-- ![View data sources](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.0.0/data-migration/CloudCanal/cloudcanal2.2.5.36/4%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E6%BA%90%E5%B1%95%E7%A4%BA.png) -->

### Step 2: Create a task

After you add data sources, perform the following steps to perform full migration, incremental synchronization, or schema migration.

1. Choose **Task Management** > **Create Task**.

   <!-- ![Manage tasks](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.0.0/data-migration/CloudCanal/cloudcanal2.2.5.36/5%E4%BB%BB%E5%8A%A1%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86.png) -->

2. Set the source and destination databases.

   * Select the task running cluster. The task will be scheduled to a server that is bound to the cluster. After CloudCanal Community Edition is deployed, a default running cluster is created. Select **Default Cluster** in the drop-down list as the task running cluster.

   * Select the source MySQL instance and the destination OceanBase instance, and then click **Test Connection**.

   * Select the source and destination databases for migration, synchronization, or verification to specify the database mapping.

   * Click **Next**.

   <!-- ![Set the source and destination databases](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.0.0/data-migration/CloudCanal/cloudcanal2.2.5.36/6%E6%BA%90%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AEmysql-to-ob.png) -->

3. Complete the feature settings.

   Select **Incremental Synchronization**. At the first synchronization, CloudCanal checks the table and performs full synchronization. Afterward, CloudCanal consumes binlogs to synchronize only incremental data.

   * Task types include:

      * Full Migration: applies mainly to data migration. You can select this type for full data migration and provisional incremental synchronization.
      * Incremental Synchronization: applies to data synchronization. This is the default value. By default, **Full Initialization** is enabled for this task type. This task type applies to long-term incremental synchronization.
      * Data Verification: compares data in the source and destination databases to verify the accuracy of migrated data on a one-off or periodic basis. CloudCanal Community Edition does not support this feature.
      * Schema Migration: automatically creates the corresponding database and tables based on the selected database and tables.
      * Data Correction: compares the data in the source and destination databases and overrides the inconsistent data in the destination database with that in the source database. CloudCanal Community Edition does not support this feature.

   * Task Specifications: Use the default specifications, namely the **Balanced** specifications with **2G** memory.

   * Click **Next**.

   <!-- ![Complete the feature settings](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.0.0/data-migration/CloudCanal/cloudcanal2.2.5.36/7%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE.png) -->

4. Perform table and action filtering.

   * Select the table to be synchronized. Make sure that the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations performed on the destination database are consistent with those performed on the source database. In addition, make sure that the tables in the source database have a `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE KEY` constraint.

   * Click **Next**.

   <!-- ![Perform table and action filtering](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.0.0/data-migration/CloudCanal/cloudcanal2.2.5.36/8%E8%A1%A8%26action%E8%BF%87%E6%BB%A4_%E5%A2%9E%E9%87%8F%E5%90%8C%E6%AD%A5.png) -->

5. Perform data processing.

   * Select the columns to be synchronized in the table.

   * Click **Next**.

   <!-- ![Perform data processing](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.0.0/data-migration/CloudCanal/cloudcanal2.2.5.36/9%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%A4%84%E7%90%86.png) -->

6. Confirm the task information.

   Confirm the task information and then click **OK** to create the task.

   <!-- ![Confirm task information](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.0.0/data-migration/CloudCanal/cloudcanal2.2.5.36/10%E7%A1%AE%E8%AE%A4%E5%88%9B%E5%BB%BA%E4%BB%BB%E5%8A%A1.png) -->

### Step 3: View the task status

After the task is created, schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization are automatically performed. The progress bar will advance gradually. Return to the task management page of CloudCanal. Refresh the page and view the real-time task status, which changes from schema migration to data initialization and data synchronization.
