# Use OMS to migrate data from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to a MySQL database

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) to migrate data from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to a MySQL database. 

## Background information

You can create a data migration project in the OMS console to seamlessly migrate the existing business data and incremental data from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to a MySQL database through schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization. 

MySQL Database supports the following modes: primary database only, standby database only, and primary/standby databases. The following table describes the data migration operations supported by each mode. 


| Mode | Supported operations |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary database only | Schema migration, full migration, incremental synchronization, full verification, and reverse incremental migration |
| Standby database only | A MySQL database in this mode cannot serve as the destination for data migration. |
| Primary/standby databases | Primary database: schema migration, full migration, incremental synchronization, and reverse incremental migration</br>Secondary database: full verification</br> <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>If this mode is selected, OMS uses the standby database as the primary node for full verification. </p></main> |
