# Use OMS to migrate data from an Oracle database to an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) to migrate data from an Oracle database to an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database. 

## Background information

You can create a data migration project in the OMS console to seamlessly migrate the existing business data and incremental data from an Oracle database to an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database through schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization. 

Oracle Database supports the following modes: primary database only, standby database only, and primary/standby databases. The following table describes the data migration operations supported by each mode.

| Mode | Supported operations |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary database only | Schema migration, full migration, incremental synchronization, full verification, and reverse incremental migration |
| Standby database only | Schema migration, full migration, incremental synchronization, and full verification |
| Primary/standby databases | Primary database: reverse incremental migration. </br>Standby database: schema migration, full migration, incremental synchronization, and full verification |
