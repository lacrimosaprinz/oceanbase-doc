# Use OMS to migrate data from a TiDB database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) to migrate data from a TiDB database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database. 

## Background information

You can create a data migration project in the OMS console to seamlessly migrate the existing business data and incremental data from a TiDB database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database through schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization. 

TiDB is a distributed database that supports hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) workloads. To synchronize incremental data from a TiDB database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, You need to deploy a TiCDC cluster and a Kafka cluster.

TiCDC is an incremental data synchronization tool for TiDB and provides high availability by using a placement driver (PD) cluster, which is the scheduling module of the TiDB cluster and usually consists of three PD nodes. TiKV Server is a TiKV node in the TiDB cluster. It sends data changes in change logs to the TiCDC cluster. TiCDC runs multiple TiCDC processes to obtain and process data from TiKV nodes, and then synchronizes the data to the Kafka cluster. The Kafka cluster saves the incremental logs of the TiDB database that are converted by TiCDC. During incremental data synchronization, OMS obtains the corresponding data from the Kafka cluster and migrates the data to the MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database in real time. If you create a TiDB data source without binding it to a Kafka data source, you cannot perform incremental synchronization.
