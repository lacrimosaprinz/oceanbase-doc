# Import data by using the LOAD DATA statement

OceanBase Database allows you to use the `LOAD DATA` statement to import data from external files to database tables.

## Limitations

The `LOAD DATA` statement is not allowed for tables with triggers.

## Considerations

To speed up data import, OceanBase Database utilizes a parallel design for `LOAD DATA` operations. During this process, data to be imported is divided into multiple subtasks, which are executed in parallel. Each subtask is processed as an independent transaction, and the execution sequence is random. Therefore, the following considerations should be noted:

* The atomicity of the overall data import is not guaranteed.

* For tables without primary keys, the sequence of data writes may not match the sequence of data in the file.

## Scenarios

You can use the `LOAD DATA` statement to import a CSV file in the following process:

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>The CSV file must be located on the current OBServer node. The current OceanBase Database version does not support loading data from a remote client. </p>
  </main>

1. Parse the file.

   OceanBase Database reads data from a file based on the file name that you entered and determines whether to perform parallel or serial parsing of data from the input file based on the degree of parallelism (DOP) that you specified.

2. Distribute data.

   OceanBase Database is a distributed database system. Data of each partition may be distributed across different OBServer nodes. The `LOAD DATA` statement is used to process the parsed data and determine the OBServer node to which the data is sent.

3. Insert data.

   After the destination OBServer node receives the data, it executes the `INSERT` statement to insert the data into the corresponding partition.

## LOAD DATA

### Obtain the privilege to execute the LOAD DATA statement

You need to perform the following steps to grant the access to a file on the server:

1. Set the directory where the security file resides to the directory where the file is located or to null (indicating that no check is required).

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
       <p>For security reasons, when you set the system variable <code>secure_file_priv</code>, you can only connect to the database through a local socket to execute the SQL statement that modifies the global variable. For more information, see <a href="../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/200.system-variable/300.global-system-variable/11500.secure_file_priv-global.md">secure_file_priv</a>. </p> 
   </main>

   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL SECURE_FILE_PRIV = "";
   ```

2. Grant privileges to the user.

   Execute the following statement to grant the FILE privilege to the user specified by `USER_NAME`, which is the user who needs to execute the `LOAD DATA` statement.

   ```sql
   GRANT FILE ON *.* TO user_name;
   ```

### Syntax of LOAD DATA

```sql
LOAD DATA
    [/*+ parallel(N)*/] 
    INFILE 'file_name'
    [REPLACE | IGNORE] //The REPLACE and IGNORE options only apply to MySQL tenants.
    INTO TABLE tbl_name
    [{FIELDS | COLUMNS}
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
        [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char']
        [ESCAPED BY 'char']
    ]
    [LINES
        [STARTING BY 'string']
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']+
    ]
    [IGNORE number {LINES | ROWS}]
    [(col_name_var
        [, col_name_var] ...)]
```

By default, fields in the input file are mapped to columns in the destination table in a one-to-one correspondence. If you use `col_name_or_user_var` to specify the mapping relationship between fields in the input file and columns in the destination table, the `LOAD DATA` statement maps the columns in the destination table based on the specified column names. Columns that are not specified are set to `NULL`.  If the input file does not contain all the columns, the missing columns are filled based on the following mappings: character data type: empty string; numeric data type: 0; date data type: 0000-00-00. To add a null value, use "\\N" in the input file. | (id, names)                |

### Log files

If an error occurs during the import, the `INSERT` statement is rolled back, and the `LOAD DATA` statement generates a log file named `obloaddata.log <XXXXXX>` in the `\log` subdirectory of the installation directory of the observer process. The following example shows the content of a log file. The log contains the basic information about the task generated by the `LOAD DATA` statement, including the tenant name, input file name, destination table name, DOP, `LOAD DATA` command used, and error details in lines.

```unknow
