# Upgrade the arbitration service

This topic describes how to use a CLI to upgrade the arbitration service. 

## Limitations

If an OceanBase cluster is associated with the arbitration service, take note of the following limitations:

* You must upgrade the arbitration service before you upgrade the OceanBase cluster. 

* The new version of the arbitration server must be compatible with the versions of all associated clusters. You can check the `oceanbase_upgrade_dep.yml` file for version compatibility. For example, if the `can_be_upgraded_to` attribute of version A is B, which is later than version A, version B is compatible with version A. In this case, the arbitration service of version B is compatible with the OceanBase cluster whose version is A. For information about the `oceanbase_upgrade_dep.yml` file, see **Step 1: Analyze the `oceanbase_upgrade_dep.yml` file** in [Upgrade an OceanBase cluster](200.start-upgrade.md).

## Procedure

### Step 1: Confirm the upgrade process

For more information, see **Step 1: Analyze the `oceanbase_upgrade_dep.yml` file** in [Upgrade an OceanBase cluster](200.start-upgrade.md) to confirm the upgrade sequence from the current version to the target version. Determine the upgrade process based on the upgrade sequence as follows:

* **If there is a barrier version between the current version and the target version, the upgrade process is as follows:**
  
   1. Upgrade the arbitration service to the barrier version. 
   2. (Optional) Upgrade all OceanBase clusters associated with the arbitration service to the barrier version. 
   3. If several barrier versions are involved, repeat steps 1 and 2 until the arbitration service and the associated OceanBase clusters can be directly upgraded to the target version. 
   4. Upgrade the arbitration service to the target version. 
   5. Upgrade all OceanBase clusters associated with the arbitration service to the target version. 

* **If there is no barrier version between the current version and the target version, the upgrade process is as follows:**

   1. Upgrade the arbitration service to the target version. 
   2. (Optional) Upgrade all OceanBase clusters associated with the arbitration service to the target version. 

**Here is an example:**

Assume that the upgrade sequence is as follows:

* V4.1.0.0-100000982023031415 > V4.1.0.0 > V4.1.0.1 (barrier version) > V4.2.0.0
* V4.1.0.0 > V4.1.0.1 > V4.2.0.0
* V4.1.0.1 > V4.2.0.0

The following example describes how to upgrade a two-replica OceanBase cluster with the arbitration service.

* If the current arbitration service version is V4.1.0.0-100000982023031415, the upgrade process is as follows:

   1. Upgrade the arbitration service version from V4.1.0.0-100000982023031415 to the barrier version V4.1.0.1. 
   2. Upgrade the OceanBase cluster from V4.1.0.0-100000982023031415 to the barrier version V4.1.0.1. 
   3. Upgrade the arbitration service to the target version V4.2.0.0. 
   4. Upgrade the OceanBase cluster to the target version V4.2.0.0. 

* If the current arbitration service version is V4.1.0.0, the upgrade process is as follows:

   1. Upgrade the arbitration service to the target version V4.2.0.0. 
   2. Upgrade the OceanBase cluster to the target version V4.2.0.0. 

### (Optional) Step 2: Check for downgraded log streams

If the arbitration service is not associated with any OceanBase cluster, skip this step. 

Before you upgrade the arbitration service, make sure that the associated OceanBase clusters have no downgraded log streams. If an associated OceanBase cluster has a downgraded log stream, do not perform the upgrade, as it may result in the absence of the leader replica. 

You can execute the following SQL statement in the sys tenant to check for downgraded log streams. If any log stream is returned, you must stop the upgrade process. 

```sql
SELECT tenant_id,ls_id FROM GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE role = 'LEADER' AND degraded_list != "";
```

### Step 3: Upload and install the RPM package of the target version

1. Run the `scp` command to upload the OceanBase RPM package to the arbitration server. 

   ```shell
   scp $rpm_name admin@$observer_ip:/$rpm_dir
   ```

   where

   * `$rpm_name` specifies the name of the RPM package. 
   * `$observer_ip` specifies the IP address of the arbitration server. 
   * `$rpm_dir` specifies the directory where the RPM package is stored. 

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   scp oceanbase-4.2.0.0-100010022023081911.el7.x86_64.rpm admin@10.10.10.1:/home/admin/rpm
   ```

2. Install the OceanBase RPM package.

      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>If there are multiple barrier versions in the upgrade path, they should be installed and upgraded in sequence, one by one, until the final barrier version is successfully upgraded. After that, the RPM package for the target version can be installed.</p>
    </main>

   ```shell
   rpm -Uvh $rpm_name
   ```

   Here, `$rpm_name` indicates the name of the RPM package. 

### Step 4: Upgrade the arbitration service

1. Log on to the arbitration server. 

2. (Optional) Switch to the `admin` user. 

   If you have logged on to the arbitration server as the `admin` user, skip this step. 

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   [root@xxx /home/admin/oceanbase/etc]# su - admin
   ```

3. Run the following command to obtain the process ID of the node:

   ```shell
   ps -ef | grep observer | grep -v grep
   ```

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   -bash-4.2$ ps -ef | grep observer | grep -v grep
   admin    103364      1 99  2022 ?        51-17:24:41 /home/admin/oceanbase/bin/observer
   ```

4. Run the following command to stop the arbitration server process:

   ```shell
   kill -9 $pid
   ```

   Here, `$pid` is the process ID of the arbitration server. 

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   -bash-4.2$ kill -9 103364
   ```

5. Run the following command to restart the arbitration server process:

   ```shell
   -bash-4.2$ cd /home/admin/oceanbase && /home/admin/oceanbase/bin/observer
   ```

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>You do not need to specify the startup parameters when you restart the arbitration server process because the startup parameters of the earlier version are automatically written to the parameter file. </p>
    </main>

### (Optional) Step 5: Upgrade the OceanBase cluster

If the arbitration service is not associated with any OceanBase cluster, skip this step.
