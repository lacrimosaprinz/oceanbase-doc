# Failures of the majority of nodes

The failures of the majority of nodes will affect the majority of replicas in some log streams.

When the majority of nodes fail, some log streams will lack a leader for a long period. In this case, it is the top priority to recover services. You must identify the cause of the failure as soon as possible and try to troubleshoot the issue. For example, you can check whether the node failure is caused by a network or hardware exception. In the event of a majority-node failure caused by clog deletion or hardware failure, the cluster cannot be recovered. Recovery can only be achieved through physical backup restoration or failover to a physical backup database.
