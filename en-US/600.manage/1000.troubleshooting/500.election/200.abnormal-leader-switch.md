# Leader switchover exceptions

The switchover of the election leader is affected by the following exceptions:

* `CLOG_DISK_HANG`: The clog disk hangs for more than 5s. To resolve the exception, you can adjust the tolerance time by setting the cluster parameter `log_storage_warning_tolerance_time`.
* `SLOG_WRITE_HANG`: The slog-writing thread hangs for more than 5s. To resolve the exception, you can adjust the tolerance time by setting the cluster parameter `data_storage_warning_tolerance_time`.
* `SSTABLE_IO_HANG`: The data disk hangs.
* `CLOG_DISK_FULL`: The clog disk is full.
* `SCHEMA_NOT_REFRESHED`: The schema is not refreshed.

When the election leader detects any of the preceding exceptions in the local server, it lowers its election priority and selects a replica with a higher priority to trigger a re-election. You can check the leader switchover exception events and the corresponding causes by querying the `DBA_OB_SERVER_EVENT_HISTORY` view.

```
obclient>
select * from DBA_OB_SERVER_EVENT_HISTORY where module='FAILURE_DETECTOR' limit 10;
```

You can execute the following statement to query the `DBA_OB_SERVER_EVENT_HISTORY` view to check the corresponding election events:

```
obclient>
select * from DBA_OB_SERVER_EVENT_HISTORY where module like '%ELECTION%' limit 10;
```
