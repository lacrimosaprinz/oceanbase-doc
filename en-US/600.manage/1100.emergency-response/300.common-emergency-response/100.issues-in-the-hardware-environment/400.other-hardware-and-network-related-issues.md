# Other hardware and network issues

This topic covers other potential hardware and network 
issues, excluding node failure, network jitter, and ODP failure. It also provides the corresponding emergency handling procedure.

## Emergency handling procedure

In addition to common issues like node failure, network jitter, and ODP failure, there are other hardware and network issues, such as disk I/O exceptions, disk recognition failures, network card exceptions, and node CPU/memory exceptions. These issues often result in increased response time (RT) and transaction commit failures.

* For any suspected hardware issues, you can start by running the `stop server` command. This is a safe operation without data loss and is the most effective method for immediate fault isolation. However, please note that this operation will cause an error when a client attempts to access the node. If possible, run the `isolate server` command first. Here is an example:
   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM ISOLATE SERVER 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:2882';
   ALTER SYSTEM  STOP SERVER 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:2882';
   ```

* For any hardware issues, simply replace the faulty server.
