# Tenant memory full

If the tenant memory (MemStore) is full, it is usually caused by sudden batch data import operations. This topic provides information on how to handle this issue in emergency situations.

## Emergency handling procedure

If tenant memory is filled up, it is usually manifested as write failures with error messages like `No memory or reach tenant memory limit` or `Over tenant memory limits`. The emergency handling procedure is as follows:

1. Increase the tenant memory configuration. It is recommended to directly expand tenant memory in OCP by referring to OCP User Guide. If you use the command line, perform the following sub-steps:

   1. Execute the following SQL statement to confirm the `unit_config` used by the current tenant.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>Multiple replicas may use different resource pools, so you need to modify the configurations of each replica separately. </p>
      </main>
    
          ```sql
          SELECT a.tenant_name,a.tenant_id,b.name unit_config,c.name pool_name,b.max_cpu,b.min_cpu
          FROM
          OCEANBASE.DBA_OB_TENANTS a,
          OCEANBASE.DBA_OB_UNIT_CONFIGS b,
          OCEANBASE.DBA_OB_RESOURCE_POOLS c
          WHERE a.tenant_id=c.tenant_id
          AND b.unit_config_id = c.unit_config_id
          ORDER BY a.tenant_id desc;
          ```

   2. Execute the following SQL statement based on the obtained configurations.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>As of OceanBase Database V3.2, you can modify only the CPU and memory configurations of a <code>resource unit</code>. The modifications to other I/O configurations, such as disk and IOPS, are temporarily ineffective and can be left as default. </p>
      </main>
    
          ```sql
          ALTER resource unit unit_config_name min_cpu = 2,max_cpu = 2,MEMORY_SIZE = '2G',max_iops = 10000,min_iops = 10000;
          ```

2. Increase the number of threads for minor compaction.

   Data occupies a large amount of memory before a minor compaction. The `compaction_mid_thread_score` parameter specifies the number of threads for minor compaction. Increasing the value of this parameter can speed up the minor compaction and the release of the occupied memory. The default value is `0`, which indicates that only one thread is used for minor compaction. The modification to this parameter takes effect immediately without the need to restart the OBServer node.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>Increasing the value of this parameter results in higher CPU usage. Decide whether to make a modification according to your specific situation. </p>
      </main>

    
    To change the value of this parameter, log in to the `sys` tenant in the cluster as the `root` user and execute the following statement:
    
    ```sql
    ALTER SYSTEM SET compaction_mid_thread_score=x;
    ```
    
    After modifying the parameter, you can execute the `SHOW PARAMETERS` statement to check whether the modification is successful.
    
    ```sql
    SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'compaction_mid_thread_score';
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can increase the number of threads for minor compaction by modifying the minor compaction strategy in the OCP console. For more information, see [Modify minor compaction settings](../../../../700.reference/200.system-management/500.manage-data-storage/100.dump-management/500.modify-dump-configuration.md).

3. If the total memory of the tenant cannot be expanded, you can reduce the `freeze_trigger_percentage` while increasing the `memstore_limit_percentage` to speed up the minor compaction.

   The `freeze_trigger_percentage` parameter specifies the threshold for triggering a minor compaction. The default value of this parameter is 20, which indicates that a minor compaction is triggered if the MemStore usage exceeds 20%.

   The `memstore_limit_percentage` parameter specifies the percentage of writable MemStore memory in the total tenant memory. The default value is 50, which indicates that the writable MemStore memory occupies 50% of the total memory available for the tenant. For example, if the total memory of a tenant is 10 GB, the writable portion for MemStore is 5 GB. The value of this parameter ranges from 1 to 99. The modification to this parameter takes effect immediately without the need to restart the OBServer node.

   To change the values of the two parameters, log in to the `sys` tenant in the cluster as the `root` user and execute the following statement:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM SET freeze_trigger_percentage=40;
   ALTER SYSTEM SET memstore_limit_percentage=70;
   ```

4. Trigger write throttling. 

   As a tenant-level parameter, `writing_throttling_trigger_percentage` specifies the threshold of write throttling. If the MemStore memory usage exceeds the threshold, write throttling is triggered. The default value of this parameter is 60, which indicates that write throttling is triggered if the MemStore usage exceeds 60%. The value of this parameter ranges from 0 to 100. The modification to this parameter takes effect immediately without the need to restart the OBServer node. 
   
   Another related parameter is `writing_throttling_maximum_duration`, which specifies the maximum duration of the remaining memory to support writing after write throttling is triggered. The default value is 1 hour. Generally, you do not need to modify this parameter.

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM SET writing_throttling_trigger_percentage = 80;
   ALTER SYSTEM SET writing_throttling_maximum_duration = '1h';
   ```

5. Deprioritize batch processing tasks on the application side for the tenant.
