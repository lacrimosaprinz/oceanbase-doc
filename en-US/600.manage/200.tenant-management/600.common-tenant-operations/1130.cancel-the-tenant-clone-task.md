# Cancel tenant cloning

You can cancel an ongoing tenant cloning job. After the tenant cloning job is canceled, the job status changes to `CANCELED`, and the system automatically releases the resources allocated to the job.

## Considerations

If the new tenant has been created and switched to the normal service state before you cancel the tenant cloning job, an error will be returned when you execute the cancellation statement.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   ```shell
   obclient -h172.30.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#cluster -p**** -A
   ```

2. Execute the following statement to cancel an ongoing tenant cloning job:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL CLONE new_tenant_name;
   ```

   Here, `new_tenant_name` specifies the name of the new tenant.

3. After the statement is executed, you can query the cloning job history from a view.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_CLONE_HISTORY\G
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
           CLONE_JOB_ID: 1702212525544202404
               TRACE_ID: YA4740B7C050F-00060C210F4A4859-0-0

               RET_CODE: -4072
          ERROR_MESSAGE: clone job has been canceled

   ```

   The query result shows that the job status has changed to `CLONE_SYS_CANCELED`.
