# Query log stream upgrade/downgrade information

After you enable the arbitration service for a tenant, you can query views for information about the upgrade or downgrade of log streams in the tenant.

## Query log stream upgrade/downgrade events

You can query the `DBA_OB_SERVER_EVENT_HISTORY` view in the `sys` tenant for the upgrade and downgrade events of all log streams.

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statements to query whether log stream upgrade or downgrade events have occurred.

   * Query log stream downgrade events

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_SERVER_EVENT_HISTORY WHERE event LIKE "%DEGRADE%";
      ```

      If the query result is empty, no log stream is downgraded. Otherwise, the query result shows the information about log stream replicas that have downgraded.

   * Query log stream upgrade events

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_SERVER_EVENT_HISTORY WHERE event LIKE "%UPGRADE%";
      ```

      If the query result is empty, no log stream is upgraded. Otherwise, the query result shows the information about log stream replicas that have upgraded.

## Query the log stream upgrade/downgrade result

After a log stream upgrade or downgrade event occurs, you can query the `GV$OB_LOG_STAT` view in the `sys` tenant or the `V$OB_LOG_STAT` view in a user tenant for the upgrade or downgrade result of the log stream.

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant or a user tenant as the administrator.

2. Execute the following statement to query the log stream upgrade or downgrade result.

   * `sys` tenant

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE tenant_id= xxxx;
      ```

   * User tenant

      :::tab
      tab MySQL mode

      The syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE tenant_id= xxxx;
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      The syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM SYS.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE tenant_id= xxxx;
      ```

      :::

   In the query result, view the `DEGRADED_LIST` column corresponding to the log stream replica whose role is `LEADER`. If a log stream downgrade event occurs, the log stream replica downgraded due to an exception is displayed in this column. If a log stream upgrade event occurs, the upgraded replica is removed from this column.
