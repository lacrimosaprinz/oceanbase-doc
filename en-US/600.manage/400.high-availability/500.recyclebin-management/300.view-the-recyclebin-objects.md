# View objects in the recycle bin

You can execute the `SHOW RECYCLEBIN` statement to query for objects in the recycle bin.

## Considerations

You can delete tenants only in the `sys` tenant. Therefore, MySQL and Oracle user tenants can be moved only to the recycle bin of the `sys` tenant after they are dropped. In the `sys` tenant, you can view databases, tables, and indexes of the current tenant as well as those of all other tenants in the recycle bin. In a MySQL user tenant, you can view only databases, tables, and indexes in the recycle bin. In an Oracle user tenant, you can view only tables and indexes in the recycle bin.

## Background information

When you drop a database object or tenant:

* If the recycle bin is enabled, the object is moved to the recycle bin and can be viewed in the recycle bin.

* If the recycle bin is disabled, the object is not moved to the recycle bin and cannot be viewed in the recycle bin.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the database as an administrator of the `sys` tenant or a user tenant.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>The administrator user of a MySQL user tenant is <code>root</code> and that of an Oracle user tenant is <code>SYS</code>. </li>
      <li>If you want to view tenants in the recycle bin, log on to the database as an administrator of the <code>sys</code> tenant. </li>
      </ul>
      </main>


   Note that you must specify the corresponding fields in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

      ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys -p***** -A
      ```

   For more information about how to connect to a database, see [Overview (MySQL mode)](../../../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md) or [Overview (Oracle mode)](../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-oracle-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-oracle-mode.md).

2. Execute the following statement to view the objects in the recycle bin.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SHOW RECYCLEBIN;
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+--------+----------------------------+
   | OBJECT_NAME                         | ORIGINAL_NAME     | TYPE   | CREATETIME                 |
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+--------+----------------------------+
   | RECYCLE_$_100017_1672050541224936   | oracle001         | TENANT | 2023-01-16 11:01:40.258000 |
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673426335319344 | __idx_500788_idx1 | INDEX  | 2023-01-11 16:38:55.318878 |
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673426335329040 | __idx_500788_idx2 | INDEX  | 2023-01-11 16:38:55.328312 |
   | __recycle_$_100017_1673426335331800 | t1                | TABLE  | 2023-01-11 16:38:55.331481 |
   +-------------------------------------+-------------------+--------+----------------------------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

   The parameters in the returned result are described as follows:

   * `OBJECT_NAME` indicates the name of an object in the recycle bin.

   * `ORIGINAL_NAME` indicates the original name of the object.

   * `TYPE` indicates the type of the object in the recycle bin.  

      * `sys` tenant: `INDEX`, `TABLE`, `DATABASE`, and `TENANT`. In this example, `oracle001` is a tenant object in the recycle bin.

      * MySQL user tenants: `INDEX`, `TABLE`, and `DATABASE`.

      * Oracle user tenants: `INDEX` and `TABLE`.

   * `CREATETIME` indicates the time when the object was placed in the recycle bin.
