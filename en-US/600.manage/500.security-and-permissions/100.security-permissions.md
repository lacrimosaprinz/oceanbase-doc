# Overview

Security is one of the top priorities for a database. A database management system is required to prevent unauthorized use of the database and protect the files and data of the database. This topic describes the security system of OceanBase Database.

As the final data carrier, OceanBase Database prioritizes data security. OceanBase Database provides a full range of enterprise-level security features to ensure data security. The security features include authentication, access control, data encryption, monitoring and alerting, and security audit.

* Authentication

   OceanBase Database supports identity authentication and user and role management to improve database security. For more information, see [Authentication](200.identification-and-authentication/100.identification-and-authentication-of-mysql-mode/100.identification-of-mysql-mode.md).

* Access control

   OceanBase Database manages user access to data by defining system and object privileges and roles. For more information, see [Access control](300.access-control/100.access-control-overview.md).

* Data encryption

   OceanBase Database supports encrypting data for transmission and storage. OceanBase Database supports end-to-end data encryption at the transport layer. In addition, OceanBase Database supports transparent encryption of stored data to maximize data security even when the storage medium is lost. For more information, see [Data transmission encryption](400.data-transfer-encryption/100.data-transfer-encryption-overview.md) and [Transparent data encryption](500.data-storage-encryption/100.datastore-encryption-overview.md).

* Security audit

   OceanBase Database audits user behavior and records user operations. OceanBase Database also supports the audit of database objects. Audit information is generated when you access data to ensure that data access behavior is correctly recorded. For more information, see [Security audit](600.security-audit/100.security-audit-overview.md).
