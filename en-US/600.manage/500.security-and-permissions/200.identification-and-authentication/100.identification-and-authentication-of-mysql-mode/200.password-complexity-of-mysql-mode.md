# Password complexity

To prevent malicious password attacks, OceanBase Database allows you to set a password complexity function as needed to verify the logon identity and improve database security. This topic describes how to set password complexity for users who attempt to log on to OceanBase Database. 

## Related variables

In the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, you can specify password complexity rules by configuring a series of tenant-level system variables. When you create a user or change a user's logon password, the logon password is verified based on the configured system variables. If the password verification fails, an error will be reported. The following table describes the relevant system variables.

| Variable | Description | Usage notes |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| validate_password_check_user_name | Whether the user password can be the same as the username.  | <ul><li>`on`: The user password cannot be the same as the username. </li><li>`off`: The user password can be the same as the username. The default value is `off`. </li></ul> |
| validate_password_length | The minimum length of a user's password.  | Default value: `0`.  |
| validate_password_mixed_case_count | The minimum number of uppercase or lowercase letters required in a user's password.  | Default value: `0`.  |
| validate_password_number_count | The minimum number of digits required in a user's password.  | Default value: `0`.  |
| validate_password_policy | The password check policy.  | <ul><li>`low`: specifies to check only the password length. </li><li>`medium`: specifies to check the password length, the number of uppercase letters, the number of lowercase letters, the number of digits, the number of special characters, and whether the user password can be the same as the username.  |
| validate_password_special_char_count | The minimum number of special characters required in a user's password.  | Default value: `0`.  |

## Set password complexity

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>In a production environment, it is recommended to set a password length of 20 characters, including digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. The lower the complexity of the password, the greater the likelihood that it will be cracked, such as including the username, using repeated characters, etc. For security reasons, it is necessary to ensure that user passwords have high complexity. 
    </li></p>
  </main>

The following example provides guidance on setting password complexity rules. In this example, the password has a minimum length of 8 characters, including at least 3 uppercase letters, 3 lowercase letters, and 1 special character; the password cannot be the same as the username, and the password check policy is set to `medium`. 

1. Log on to a MySQL tenant of a cluster as the root user. 

   ```shell
   obclient -uroot@mysql -P2881 -h10.xxx.xxx.1 -p*******
   ```

2. Set password complexity through system variables. 

   ```shell
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_check_user_name=on;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_length=8;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_mixed_case_count=3;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_special_char_count=1;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_policy='medium';
   ```

3. Log off and log on again to check whether the variables have taken effect. 

   ```shell
   obclient> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'validate%';
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   | VARIABLE_NAME                        | VALUE  |
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   | validate_password_check_user_name    | on     |
   | validate_password_length             | 8      |
   | validate_password_mixed_case_count   | 3      |
   | validate_password_number_count       | 0      |
   | validate_password_policy             | medium |
   | validate_password_special_char_count | 1      |
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
   ```

4. Verify password complexity. 

   Create two users, one with a password that meets the requirements and the other with a password that does not. 

   ```shell
   obclient> CREATE USER sectest1 IDENTIFIED BY '******';
   ERROR 1819 (HY000): Your password does not satisfy the current policy
   requirements
   
   obclient> CREATE USER sectest1 IDENTIFIED BY '***1_%';
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

   The creation of the user with a password that does not meet the requirements fails.
