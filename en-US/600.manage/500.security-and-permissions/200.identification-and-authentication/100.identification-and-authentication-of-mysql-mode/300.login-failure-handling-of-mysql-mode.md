# Logon failure processing

In the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, for users who have multiple failed logon attempts, the system will lock the users to prevent malicious password attacks, thereby improving database security.

## Logon failure processing policy

In the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, the tenant-level parameter `connection_control_failed_connections_threshold` controls the threshold of failed logon attempts. The value range is \[0,2147483647\], and the default value is `0`. 

Note the following:

* When this parameter is set to `0`, no action will be taken against the failed logon attempts.

* When this parameter is not set to `0`, if the number of a user's consecutive failed logon attempts exceeds the value of this parameter, the user will be locked. The lock duration is calculated by using the following formula:

   `MIN(MAX((current_failed_login_num + 1 - connection_control_failed_connections_threshold) * 1000, connection_control_min_connection_delay), connection_control_max_connection_delay)`

   where

   * `current_failed_login_num` indicates the number of consecutive failed logon attempts by the user. The value of the `current_failed_login_num` parameter is greater than or equal to that of the `connection_control_failed_connections_threshold` parameter.

   * `connection_control_min_connection_delay` indicates the minimum lock duration after the number of consecutive failed logon attempts exceeds the specified threshold. The value range is \[1000,2147483647\], and the default value is `1000`, in milliseconds.

      For more information about the `connection_control_min_connection_delay` parameter, see [connection_control_min_connection_delay](../../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/400.tenant-level-configuration-items/600.connection_control_min_connection_delay.md).

   * `connection_control_max_connection_delay` indicates the maximum lock duration after the number of consecutive failed logon attempts exceeds the specified threshold. The value range is \[1000,2147483647\], and the default value is `2147483647`, in milliseconds.

      For more information about the `connection_control_max_connection_delay` parameter, see [connection_control_max_connection_delay](../../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/400.tenant-level-configuration-items/700.connection_control_max_connection_delay.md).

## Configuration example

1. Log on to a MySQL tenant of a cluster as the root user.

   ```shell
   obclient -uroot@mysql -h127.1 -P2881 -p********
   ```

2. Set the threshold of failed logon attempts to 5, and set the minimum lock duration and maximum lock duration after the number of consecutive failed logon attempts reaches the specified threshold to 60,000 ms and 360,000 ms respectively.


   ```shell
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET connection_control_failed_connections_threshold=5;

   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET connection_control_min_connection_delay=60000;

   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET connection_control_max_connection_delay=360000;
   ```

   For more information about the parameters, see [Modify cluster parameters](../../../../700.reference/200.system-management/200.configuration-management/200.set-parameters.md).

3. Create a user.

   ```shell
   obclient> CREATE USER 'test' IDENTIFIED BY '*******';
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)
   ```

4. Check whether the logon failure processing policy has taken effect.

   If five consecutive incorrect passwords are entered, the user will be locked.

   ```shell
   obclient -h127.1 -P2881 -utest@mysql -p*******;
   obclient: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
   ERROR 5039 (01007): User locked
   ```

   Log on to a `MySQL` tenant of OceanBase Database using the `root` user and view information about failed logon attempts.

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT * FROM information_schema.CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS;
   +-------------+-----------------+
   | USERHOST    | FAILED_ATTEMPTS |
   +-------------+-----------------+
   | 'test'@'%' |               5 |
   +-------------+-----------------+
   1 row in set (0.005 sec)
   ```

5. Unlock the user.

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>The operation of unlocking a user is generally performed by the administrator. If a regular user needs to perform the unlocking operation, they must have the global <code>ALTER USER</code> privilege.

   </main>

   ```shell
      obclient> ALTER USER test ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
   ```
