# Logon failure processing

In the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database, for users who have multiple failed logon attempts, the system will lock the users to prevent malicious password attacks, thereby improving database security.

The Oracle mode of OceanBase Database uses a profile to lock a user.

  <h4>Applicability</h4>
  <p>This topic applies only to the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database. OceanBase Database Community Edition only supports MySQL mode. For more information about logon failure processing in MySQL mode, see <a href="../100.identification-and-authentication-of-mysql-mode/300.login-failure-handling-of-mysql-mode.md">Logon failure processing</a>. </p>

## Concepts

Profile is a means of limiting the resources available for a database user. In the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database, the profile is used to control a user's logon verification policy. By using a user's profile file, it is possible to lock the user.

The profile file provides two parameters to lock the user after multiple consecutive logon failures:

* `failed_login_attempts`: the number of consecutive failed logon attempts.
* `password_lock_time`: the lock duration, in days.

The lock and unlock policies are as follows:

* Lock policy: When there are repeated failed logon attempts due to an incorrect password, if the failure threshold is reached, the user will be locked.
* Unlock policy: If a logged-on user is locked, the system will check the lock duration when the user attempts to log on again. If the lock duration has expired, the system will unlock the user and the user will attempt to log on again. If the lock duration has not expired, the system will return an error. You can also use SQL statements to unlock the user.

## Procedure

The administrator can create a profile and apply it to a user, which mainly includes the following two steps:

1. Create a profile.

   Use the `CREATE PROFILE` statement to create a profile and specify the number of consecutive logon failures allowed for a user and the corresponding lock duration.

   The SQL statement is as follows:

   ```sql
   CREATE PROFILE "profile_name" LIMIT
     { FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS
       | PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME
       | PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME
       | PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME
       }
       { integer | UNLIMITED | DEFAULT };
   ```

   Note the following:

   * Executing this statement requires the `CREATE PROFILE` privilege.

   * `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` specifies the number of consecutive failed logon attempts.

      If this parameter is not specified, the setting in the `DEFAULT` profile will be used. The value of this parameter in the `DEFAULT` profile is `UNLIMITED`, which indicates that there is no limit to the number of consecutive failed logon attempts.

   * `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` specifies the number of days that a user will be locked after the number of consecutive logon failures reaches the threshold.

      If this parameter is not specified, the setting in the `DEFAULT` profile will be used. The value of this parameter in the `DEFAULT` profile is `UNLIMITED`, which indicates that there is no limit to the number of days that a user will be locked.

   * `PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME` specifies the number of days during which the same password can be used for authentication.

      If this parameter is not specified, the setting in the `DEFAULT` profile will be used. The value of this parameter in the `DEFAULT` profile is `UNLIMITED`, which indicates that there is no limit to the number of days during which the same password can be used for authentication.

   * `PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME`: After the `PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME` has been reached, the system issues a warning. The `PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME` parameter is used to specify the number of days that a user is still allowed to log on after receiving the warning.

      If this parameter is not specified, the setting in the `DEFAULT` profile will be used. The value of this parameter in the `DEFAULT` profile is `UNLIMITED`, which indicates that there is no limit to the number of days that a user can log on.

   * `integer | UNLIMITED | DEFAULT` specifies the value range of a parameter.

      * `integer` indicates that the value of the parameter is an integer.

      * `UNLIMITED` indicates that the value of the parameter is not restricted.

      * `DEFAULT` indicates that the setting in the `DEFAULT` profile is used.

   For more information about the `CREATE PROFILE` statement, see [CREATE PROFILE](../../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/100.ddl-of-oracle-mode/1900.create-profile-of-oracle-mode.md).

2. Apply the profile to a user.

   There are two scenarios:

   * When creating a user, you can directly specify the profile file that has already been created.

      The SQL statement is as follows:

      ```shell
      obclient> CREATE USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY password PROFILE
      {"profile_name" | default};
      ```

      If a profile is not specified when you create a user, the `DEFAULT` profile will be used. You can query the setting of the `DEFAULT` profile through the system view `DBA_PROFILES`.

      For more information about the `CREATE USER` statement, see [CREATE USER](../../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/100.ddl-of-oracle-mode/2700.create-user-of-oracle-mode.md).

   * If the user has already been created, you can apply an existing profile file to the user by modifying their profile.

      The SQL statement is as follows:

      ```shell
      obclient> ALTER USER user_name PROFILE {"profile_name" | default};
      ```

      For more information about the `ALTER USER` statement, see [ALTER USER](../../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/100.ddl-of-oracle-mode/1200.alter-user-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Example

1. Log on to an Oracle tenant of a cluster as the `sys` user.

   ```shell
   obclient -usys@oracle -h127.1 -P2881 -  P*******
   ```

2. Create a profile and set up a policy for consecutive failed logons.

   Create a profile named `userprof1` that locks the user for one day after five consecutive failed logon attempts.

   ```shell
   obclient> CREATE PROFILE "userprof1" LIMIT FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 5
   PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME 1;
   ```

3. Check whether the setting was successful.

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT * FROM DBA_PROFILES;
   +-----------+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+
   | PROFILE   | RESOURCE_NAME            | RESOURCE_TYPE | LIMIT       |
   +-----------+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+
   | DEFAULT   | FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS    | PASSWORD      | UNLIMITED   |
   | DEFAULT   | PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME      | PASSWORD      | UNLIMITED   |
   | DEFAULT   | PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME       | PASSWORD      | UNLIMITED   |
   | DEFAULT   | PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME       | PASSWORD      | 86400000000 |
   | DEFAULT   | PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION | PASSWORD      | NULL        |
   | userprof1 | FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS    | PASSWORD      | 5           |
   | userprof1 | PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME      | PASSWORD      | DEFAULT     |
   | userprof1 | PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME       | PASSWORD      | DEFAULT     |
   | userprof1 | PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME       | PASSWORD      | 86400000000 |
   | userprof1 | PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION | PASSWORD      | DEFAULT     |
   +-----------+--------------------------+---------------+-------------+
   10 rows in set
   ```

4. Create a user and specify a profile.

   ```shell
   obclient> CREATE USER secuser IDENTIFIED BY ****** PROFILE "userprof1";

   obclient> GRANT all privileges ON *.* to secuser;
   ```

5. Verify the configuration result.

   If five consecutive incorrect passwords are entered, the user will be locked for one day.

   ```shell
   $ obclient -h127.1 -P2881 -usecuser@oracle -p*******;
   obclient: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
   ERROR 5039 (01007): User locked
   ```

   Log on to the `sys` tenant as the `root` user and view information about failed logon attempts.

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT * FROM information_schema.CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS;
   +-------------+-----------------+
   | USERHOST    | FAILED_ATTEMPTS |
   +-------------+-----------------+
   | 'test'@'%' |               5 |
   +-------------+-----------------+
   1 row in set (0.005 sec)
   ```

6. Unlock the user.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>The operation of unlocking a user is generally performed by the administrator. If a regular user needs to perform the unlocking operation, they must have the global <code>ALTER USER</code> privilege. For information about how to view and grant user privileges, see <a href="../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/600.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md">View user privileges</a> and <a href="../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/700.modify-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md">Modify user privileges</a>. </p>
    </main>

   ```shell
   obclient> ALTER USER secuser ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
   ```

## Modify the logon failure processing policy

Execute the `ALTER PROFILE` statement to modify an existing profile.

For more information about the `ALTER PROFILE` statement, see [ALTER PROFILE](../../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/100.ddl-of-oracle-mode/400.alter-profile-of-oracle-mode.md).

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>For users who have already been locked, it is not possible to unlock them by modifying <code>FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS</code> through the <code>ALTER PROFILE</code> statement. Changes made to a configuration file with the <code>ALTER PROFILE</code> statement only affect users in subsequent sessions, not those in the current session.</p>
