# Grant privileges

You can use the `GRANT` statement to grant administrator privileges, database privileges, or object privileges to users.

## Prerequisites

You must have the `GRANT OPTION` privilege and the privileges to be granted. For example, if the `test1` user wants to grant the `SELECT` privilege on the `t1` table to the `test2` user, the `test1` user must have the `GRANT OPTION` privilege and the `SELECT` privilege on the `t1` table.

For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../200.permission-of-mysql-mode/400.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md).

### Considerations

Before you grant a privilege, note the following:

* When you grant a privilege to a user, the user is automatically created if the user does not exist. However, if `sql_mode='no_auto_create_user'` is specified and `IDENTIFIED BY` is not used in the statement to specify a password, the user cannot be created directly.

* When granting multiple privileges to a user at the same time, separate the privileges with commas (,).

* When granting a privilege to multiple users at the same time, separate the usernames with commas (,).

* If a user has been granted a privilege, the privilege takes effect only after the user is reconnected to OceanBase Database.

* OceanBase Database does not support the `CHANGE EFFECTIVE TENANT` statement for privilege control. Therefore, you can grant a privilege to all users in the `sys` tenant.

### Syntax for granting privileges

The syntax for granting privileges is as follows:

```sql
GRANT priv_type 
    ON priv_level 
    TO user_specification [, user_specification]... 
     [WITH GRANT OPTION];
  
priv_level: 
      *
    | *.*
    | database_name.* 
    | database_name.table_name
    | table_name
    | database_name.routine_name

user_specification: 
user_name [IDENTIFIED BY [PASSWORD] 'password'] 
```

where

* `priv_type`: the type of the privilege to be granted. When you grant multiple privileges to a user at the same time, separate the privileges with commas (,).

   For more information about the privilege types supported in MySQL mode, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md).

* `priv_level`: the level of the privilege to be granted. The MySQL mode of OceanBase Database provides the following three levels of privileges:

   * Administrator level: Privileges at this level apply to all databases. `GRANT ... ON *.*` is used to grant administrator privileges.

   * Database level: Privileges at this level apply to all objects in a specified database. `GRANT ... ON db_name.*` is used to grant database-level privileges.

   * Table level: Privileges at this level apply to all columns in a specified table. `GRANT ... ON database_name.table_name` is used to grant table-level privileges.

* `user_specification`: the user to which one or more privileges are granted. If the user does not exist, the user is automatically created.

   When you grant a privilege to multiple users at the same time, separate the usernames with commas (,).

* `user_name IDENTIFIED BY 'password'` and `user_name IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD 'password'`: The password in the `user_name IDENTIFIED BY 'password'` clause is in plaintext. The password in the `user_name IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD 'password'` clause is in ciphertext.

* `WITH GRANT OPTION`: specifies whether the privileges can be delegated or revoked.

### Examples

* Grant administrator privileges

   Administrator privileges are global privileges that apply to all databases. You can use `GRANT ... ON *.*` to grant administrator privileges.

   * To grant all privileges on all objects in all databases to the `test` user, execute the following statement:

      ```shell
      obclient> GRANT ALL ON *.* TO test;
      ```

   * To grant the `INSERT` and `SELECT` privileges on all tables in all databases to the `test` user, execute the following statement:

      ```shell
      obclient> GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON *.* TO test;
      ```

* Grant database-level privileges

   Database-level privileges are management privileges on all objects in a specified database. You can use `GRANT ... ON db_name.*` to grant database-level privileges.

   * To grant management privileges on all objects in the `db1` database to the `test` user, execute the following statement:

      ```shell
      obclient> GRANT ALL ON db1.* TO test;
      ```

   * To grant the `INSERT` and `SELECT` privileges on all tables in the `db1` database to the `test` user, execute the following statement:

      ```shell
      obclient> GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON db1.* TO test;
      ```

* Grant table-level privileges

   Table-level privileges are management privileges on a specified table in a specified database. You can use `GRANT ... ON db_name.tb1_name` to grant table-level privileges.

   * To grant the `INSERT` and `SELECT` privileges on the `tb1_name` table in the `db1` database to the `test` user, execute the following statement:

      ```shell
      obclient> GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON db1.tb1_name TO test;
      ```

   * To grant management privileges on the `tb1_name` table in the `db1` database to the `test` user, execute the following statement:

      ```shell
      obclient> GRANT ALL ON db1.tb1_name TO test;
      ```
