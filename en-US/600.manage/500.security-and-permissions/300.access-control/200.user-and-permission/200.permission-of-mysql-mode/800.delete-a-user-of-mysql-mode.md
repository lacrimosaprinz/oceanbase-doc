# Drop a user

Use the `DROP USER` statement to drop a user.

## Prerequisites

You must have the global `CREATE USER` privilege. For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../200.permission-of-mysql-mode/400.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md). If you do not have the global `CREATE USER` privilege, contact the administrator to obtain the privilege. For information about how to grant privileges to a user, see [Modify user privileges](../200.permission-of-mysql-mode/500.modify-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Limitations

The `DELETE` statement cannot be used to delete privileges from the `mysql.user` table.

## Procedure

1. Log on to a MySQL tenant of the cluster.

2. Execute the following statement to drop one or more users:

   
   ```sql
   DROP USER user_name [, user_name...];
   ```

   where `user_name` specifies the username of the user to be dropped. When dropping multiple users at the same time, separate the usernames with commas (,).

   After a user is successfully dropped, the database objects created by the user will not be dropped, but all privileges of the user will be revoked.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient> DROP USER sqluser02;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```
