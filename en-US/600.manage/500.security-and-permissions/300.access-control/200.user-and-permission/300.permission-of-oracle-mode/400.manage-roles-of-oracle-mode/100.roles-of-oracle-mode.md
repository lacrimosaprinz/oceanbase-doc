# Overview

The Oracle mode of OceanBase Database supports role management.

In Oracle mode, a role is a combination of system and object privileges. By using roles, you can easily manage user privileges.

Roles have the following characteristics:

* Roles can be granted system or object privileges.

* Roles can be granted other roles, that is, roles can include other roles.

* A user can be granted multiple roles, and a role can also be granted to multiple users.

Currently, OceanBase Database has the following system roles by default:

* `CONNECT` role

   This role provides the `CREATE SESSION` privilege, which is a system privilege. To grant the `CREATE SESSION` privilege to a user, you can grant this privilege directly or grant the `CONNECT` role to the user.

* `RESOURCE` role

   This role provides the following system privileges: `CREATE CLUSTER`, `CREATE INDEXTYPE`, `CREATE OPERATOR`, `CREATE PROCEDURE`, `CREATE SEQUENCE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE TRIGGER`, and `CREATE TYPE`.

   You can view the privileges included in this role by querying the `DBA_SYS_PRIVS` dictionary view.

* `DBA` role

   This role is powerful and provides a large number of system privileges, such as `DELETE ANY TABLE` and `GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE`.

   You can view the privileges included in this role by querying the `DBA_SYS_PRIVS` dictionary view.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>To ensure database security, grant this role only when it is necessary. </p>
  </main>

* `PUBLIC` role

   This role applies to all users in a tenant. No privilege is granted to this role by default.

   If you grant a privilege to the `PUBLIC` role, all users in the tenant have the privilege. This means that all users can immediately perform operations authorized by the privilege.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>To ensure database security, grant a privilege to this role only when it is necessary. </p>
  </main>
