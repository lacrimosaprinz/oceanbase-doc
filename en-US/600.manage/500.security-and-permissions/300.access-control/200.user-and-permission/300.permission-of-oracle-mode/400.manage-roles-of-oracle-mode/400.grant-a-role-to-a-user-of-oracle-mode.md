# Grant a role to a user

In Oracle mode, you can grant a role to a user by using an SQL statement.

## Prerequisites

To grant a role to a user, you must have the `ADMIN OPTION` or `GRANT ANY ROLE` privilege and the role to be granted. For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../600.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the required privilege, contact the administrator to obtain the privilege. For information about how to grant privileges to a user, see [Modify user privileges](../700.modify-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). For information about how to view your roles, see [View roles](../400.manage-roles-of-oracle-mode/600.view-roles-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Syntax and examples

The SQL statement is as follows:

```sql
GRANT role_name TO grantee_user [WITH ADMID OPTION];
```

where

* `role_name` specifies the name of the role to be granted to a user. When you grant multiple roles to a user at the same time, separate role names with commas (,).

   You can grant a role to multiple users at the same time, or grant multiple roles to one or more users at the same time.

* `WITH ADMIN OPTION` specifies that the granted role can be granted to other users, and revoking the role does not automatically revoke the granted role from other users.

For example, grant the `role1` role to the `user2` user:

```sql
obclient> GRANT role1 TO user2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

For more information about the `GRANT` statement, see [GRANT](../../../../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/300.dcl-of-oracle-mode/1700.grant-of-oracle-mode.md).
