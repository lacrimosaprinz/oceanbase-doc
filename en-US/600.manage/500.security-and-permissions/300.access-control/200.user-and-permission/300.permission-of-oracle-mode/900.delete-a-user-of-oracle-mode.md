# Drop a user

Use the `DROP USER` statement to drop a user.

## Prerequisites

You must have the system privilege `DROP USER`. For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../300.permission-of-oracle-mode/600.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the system privilege `DROP USER`, contact the administrator to obtain the privilege. For information about how to grant privileges to a user, see [Modify user privileges](../300.permission-of-oracle-mode/700.modify-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md).

<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>Dropping a user will drop all objects owned by the user, including privileges, databases, tables, and so on. Please proceed with caution when performing this operation. </p>
</main>

## Procedure

1. Log on to an Oracle tenant of the cluster.

2. Execute the following statement to drop a user:

   
   ```sql
   DROP USER username CASCADE;
   ```

   where

   * `CASCADE` specifies that before dropping a user, the system will drop all objects owned by the user, including privileges, databases, tables, and so on.

   * `username` specifies the user to be dropped. Only one user can be dropped at the same time.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient> DROP USER sqluser CASCADE;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```
