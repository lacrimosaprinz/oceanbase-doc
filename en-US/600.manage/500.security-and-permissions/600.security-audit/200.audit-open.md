# Enable security audit

This topic describes how to enable security audit and set the storage location for audit records.

The audit operations in OceanBase Database are generally performed by `ORAAUDITOR`, whose password and privileges are specified by the `sys` user.

## Limitations

Currently, only the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database supports the security audit feature.

## Procedure

1. Log on to an Oracle tenant as the `sys` user and unlock the `ORAAUDITOR` user.

   ```shell
   obclient> ALTER USER ORAAUDITOR ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>OceanBase Database automatically creates the <code>ORAAUDITOR</code> user. This user is locked by default and needs to be unlocked before you enable security audit. </p>
   </main>

2. Change the logon password of the `ORAAUDITOR` user.

   For security purposes, the logon password of the `ORAAUDITOR` user needs to be specified by the `sys` user. If you need to change the password later, simply specify a new password.

   ```shell
   obclient> ALTER USER ORAAUDITOR IDENTIFIED BY ******;
   ```

3. Grant privileges to the `ORAAUDITOR` user.

   By default, the `ORAAUDITOR` user has no privileges. To perform security audit operations, this user needs to be granted the `CREATE SESSION` privilege using the `GRANT` statement. If you want the `ORAAUDITOR` user to be able to view audit records, you also need to grant the `SELECT ANY DICTIONARY` privilege to the user.

   ```shell
   obclient> GRANT CREATE SESSION, SELECT ANY DICTIONARY TO ORAAUDITOR;
   ```

4. Enable security audit and set the storage location for audit records.

   The security audit feature is controlled by the `audit_trail` parameter. The configuration takes effect immediately after this parameter is set. The valid values of this parameter are as follows:

   * `NONE`: disables security audit. This is the default value.

   * `OS`: writes audit records to local disk files.

   * `DB`: writes audit records to internal tables.

   * `DB,EXTENDED / DB_EXTENDED`: writes audit records (including executed SQL statements) to internal tables.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET audit_trail = 'DB,EXTENDED';
   ```

   For more information about the `audit_trail` parameter, see [audit_trail](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/400.tenant-level-configuration-items/200.audit_trail.md).

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>Audit records support two methods of storage:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Writing to local disk files: Audit records are asynchronously written to <code><Installation Directory>/audit/</code>, by default located at <code>/home/admin/oceanbase/audit/observer_xx_xxxxxx.aud</code>. </li>
      <li>Writing to internal tables: Audit records are directly written to system tables. The internal table <code>__all_tenant_security_audit_record</code> stores the audit records, while the internal table <code>__all_virtual_audit_operation</code> or <code>__all_virtual_audit_action</code> stores the mappings of audit-related <code>IDs</code> and <code>Names</code>. </li>
      </ul>
   </main>

## What to do next

Set audit rules after you enable security audit. For information about how to set audit rules, see [Set and view audit rules](../600.security-audit/300.set-up-and-view-audit-rules.md).

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>Auditing starts only after the <code>ORAAUDITOR</code> user sets audit rules. </p>
   </main>
