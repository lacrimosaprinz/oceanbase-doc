# Set and view audit rules

After you enable security audit, it is necessary to set specific audit rules to audit user operations.

## Limitations

Currently, only the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database supports the security audit feature.

## Set audit rules

Log on to an Oracle tenant as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and set the following types of audit rules:

* Statement audit rule: Audits specific operations without specifying specific objects. It can be applied to specific users or all users.
* Object audit rule: Audits specific operations that are performed on specific objects. It can be applied to specific users or all users.

Execute the `AUDIT` and `NOAUDIT` statements to set audit rules, which are also a type of schema object.

For more information about audit rules, see [AUDIT](../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/300.dcl-of-oracle-mode/200.audit-of-oracle-mode.md).

Here is an example. To audit `user1`'s `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations on table `tbl1`, execute the following statement:

```shell
obclient> AUDIT INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON user1.tbl1;
```

## View audit rules

After setting audit rules, you can view them by using a series of Oracle-compatible dictionary views.

| Dictionary view | Description |
|-----------|--------|
| [ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/900.all_def_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | Records the default audit rules for new objects. The valid values of each column are:<ul><li>  <code>-/-</code>: No auditing is performed by default. </li><li> <code>A/-</code>: Auditing is performed only when the statement execution is successful. </li><li> <code>-/A</code>: Auditing is performed only when the statement execution fails. </li><li> <code>A/A</code>: Auditing is performed regardless of whether the statement execution is successful. </li></ul> |
| [DBA_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/10000.dba_stmt_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | Records detailed configurations for statement audit.  |
| [DBA_OBJ_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/8500.dba_obj_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | Records detailed configurations for object audit.  |


Here is an example. To view the audit rules in the `ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS` view, execute the following statement:

```shell
obclient> SELECT * FROM SYS.ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS;
```
