# Audit user logon operations

This topic describes how to use the security audit feature to audit user logon operations.

## Limitations

Currently, only the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database supports the security audit feature.

## Audit the logon operations of a specific user

Log on to the database as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and audit the logon operations of `user1`.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT SESSION BY user1;
```

## Audit the logon operations of all users

Log on to the database as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and audit the logon operations of all users.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT SESSION;
```

## View audit records

View the audit records in the `DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL` view.

```shell
obclient> SELECT USERNAME,USERHOST,TIMESTAMP,SQL_TEXT FROM SYS.DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL;
+----------+----------------+-----------+----------+
| USERNAME | USERHOST       | TIMESTAMP | SQL_TEXT |
+----------+----------------+-----------+----------+
| USER1    | 10.10.10.10    | 22-DEC-21 | CONNECT  |
+----------+----------------+-----------+----------+
1 row in set
```
