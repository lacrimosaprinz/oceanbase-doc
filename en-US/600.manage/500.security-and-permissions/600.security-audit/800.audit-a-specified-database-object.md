# Audit specified database objects

OceanBase Database supports auditing specified database objects and recording only specific operations performed on these objects. The auditable database objects include tables, sequences, and views.

## Limitations

Currently, only the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database supports the security audit feature.

## Audit a single user's operations on specified database objects

Here is an example.

To audit the `aud` user's insert operations on the `tab1` table, log on to the database as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and enable the security audit feature.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT INSERT ON tab1 BY aud;
```

## Audit all users' operations on specified database objects

Here is an example.

To audit all users' failed DML operations on the `tab1` table, log on to the database as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and enable the security audit feature.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON tab1 WHENEVER NOT SUCCESSFUL;
```
