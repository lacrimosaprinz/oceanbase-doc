# Introduction to physical backup and restore

The backup and restore module is a core component of OceanBase Database, designed to ensure high availability and protect data security. It effectively prevents misoperations and safeguards against damages to the storage media. In the event of data loss caused by misoperations or storage media damage, you can rely on the backup and restore module to recover and restore the lost data.

## Overview

The current version of OceanBase Database supports Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS), Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS), and Network File System (NFS) as the backup media and provides the backup, restore, and cleanup features.

OceanBase Database supports tenant-level physical backup. Physical backup data includes backup data and archive log data. Therefore, physical backup consists of log archiving and data backup. The tenants mentioned in this topic are user tenants. Physical backup is not supported for `sys` tenants or meta tenants.

Data backup refers to the backup of data, and includes full backup and incremental backup:

* Full backup refers to the backup of all macroblocks.

* Incremental backup refers to the backup of macroblocks that are added or modified since the last backup.

<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>To perform physical backup, you must first enable log archiving. </p>
</main>

Data backup covers the following data:

* Tenant information, including the tenant name, cluster name, time zone, locality, and tenant mode (MySQL or Oracle)

* All user table data

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Data backup does not back up tenant parameters, system variables, and private system table data. </p>
</main>

The directories created by the backup feature in the backup destination and types of files in the directories are as follows:

In the data backup directory, the top-level directory contains three types of data:

* `format.obbak` and `check_file`: Check the connectivity of the data backup directory.

* `backup_sets`: The summary directory that contains all data backup sets.

* `backup_set_1_full`: This directory represents a data backup set, where the directory name ending with `full` indicates a full backup, and `inc` indicates an incremental backup. Each data backup generates a corresponding backup set, and the backup set will not be modified after the data backup is completed.

   A data backup set mainly includes the following data:

   * `backup_set_1_full_20230111T193330_20230111T193420.obbak`: This file records the ID, start time, and end time of the current backup set. This file is used only for display purposes.

   * `single_backup_set_info.obbak`: This file records the metadata of the current backup set, including the backup timestamp, dependent logs, and other information.

   * `tenant_backup_set_infos.obbak`: This file records the metadata of all existing backup sets for the current tenant.

   * `infos`: This directory records the metadata of the data backup set.

   * `logstream_1`: This directory records all the data of log stream 1, which is the system log stream of an OceanBase tenant.

   * `logstream_1001`: This directory records all the data of log stream 1001, where log streams with numbers greater than 1000 are user log streams of an OceanBase tenant.

  In addition, each log stream backup has four types of directories. Directories with `retry` indicate log stream-level retries, and directories with `turn` indicate tenant-level retries.

   * `meta_info_xx`: This directory records log stream metadata and tablet metadata.
   * `sys_data_xx`: This directory records the data of internal system tablets in log streams.
   * `minor_data_xx`: This directory records the minor-compacted data of regular tablets.
   * `major_data_xx`: This directory records the baseline data of regular tablets.

Log archiving refers to the automatic backup of log data. OBServer nodes regularly archive log data to the specified backup path without manual triggering.

Directories at the backup destination and file types under each directory:

```javasript

        │       └── 1677588501408765915.obarc                           
        └── logstream_1001                          // Log stream 1001.
            ├── file_info.obarc                      // The list of files in log stream 1001.
            └── log
                └── 1.obarc                          // The archive files in log stream 1001.      
```

In the log archiving directory, the top-level directory contains three types of data:

* `format.obbak` and `check_file`: Check the connectivity of the log archive directory.

* `rounds`: The summary directory that records all rounds of log archiving.

* `pieces`: The summary directory that records all pieces of log archiving.

* `piece_d1002r1p1`: The piece directory for log archiving, which is named in the format of `piece_DESTID_ROUNDID_PIECEID`. Here, `DESTID` refers to the ID corresponding to `log_archive_dest`, `ROUNDID` refers to the ID of the log archiving round, which is a monotonically increasing integer, and `PIECEID` refers to the ID of the log archiving piece, which is also a monotonically increasing integer.

   A log archiving piece directory includes the following data:

   * `piece_d1002r1p1_20230111T193049_20230111T193249.obarc`: This file displays the ID, start time, and end time of the current piece and is used only for display purposes.

   * `checkpoint`: This directory is used to record the archiving timestamps of active pieces. The ObArchiveScheduler module periodically updates the timestamp information in this directory.

   * `single_piece_info.obarc`: This file records the metadata of the current piece.

   * `tenant_archive_piece_infos.obarc`: This file records the metadata of all frozen pieces in the current tenant.

   * `file_info.obarc`: This file records the list of log streams within the piece.

   * `logstream_1`: This directory records the log files of log stream 1, which is the system log stream of an OceanBase tenant.

   * `logstream_1001`: This directory records the log files of log stream 1001, where log streams with numbers greater than 1000 are user log streams of an OceanBase tenant.

   Additionally, each log stream backup contains three types of data:

   * `file_info.obarc`: This file records the list of files in the log stream.

   * `log`: This directory contains all the archive files of the current log stream, with file names consistent with those in the source cluster.

   * `schema_meta`: This directory records the metadata of data dictionaries. It is only present in the system log stream but not in user log streams.

OceanBase Database supports tenant-level and table-level restore. Tenant-level restore is the process of rebuilding a new tenant based on existing backup data. The entire restore process can be completed after you execute the `ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE TENANT` statement. The tenant-level restore process includes the restore and recovery of tenant system tables and user tables. Restore returns the required baseline data to the OBServer node of the destination tenant. Recovery returns the logs corresponding to the baseline data to the OBServer node.

Table-level restore is the process of restoring a specified table from backup data to an existing tenant, which can be the source tenant, another tenant in the same cluster, or a tenant in a different cluster.

## Feature differences between OceanBase Database V4.x and V3.x/V2.2x

### Log archiving
