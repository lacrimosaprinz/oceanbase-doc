# Experience physical backup and restore with simplified deployment

This topic provides an example of simplified deployment for you to experience the physical backup and restore feature of OceanBase Database. The deployment solution involves the following three steps:

1. Initiate log archiving.
2. Initiate data backup.
3. Initiate physical restore.

## Considerations

* This topic takes the backup of a single tenant as an example. To back up multiple tenants, you need to configure a separate path for the backup destination and archive destination for each tenant. Different tenants cannot share the same path.
* OceanBase Database supports data restore both within a cluster and across clusters.

## Prerequisites

This example uses Network File System (NFS) as the backup medium. Before you perform physical backup and restore, make sure that NFS has been deployed. For more information about how to deploy NFS, see [Deploy NFS](200.deploy-nfs.md).

## Background information

This topic takes the non-encrypted tenant `oracle_test` as an example to describe how to restore the backup data of the tenant to a new tenant named `oracle_backup`.

Here is the key information:

1. The log archive path of the source tenant is `/data/nfs/backup/archive`.
2. The default business prioritizing mode (optional) is required for archiving, and a log piece needs to be generated every two days.
3. The data backup path of the source tenant is `/data/nfs/backup/data`.
4. The resource pool of the restore destination tenant `oracle_backup` is `restore_pool`. The `Locality` replica is `F@z1`. The tenant data needs to be restored to the latest timestamp.

   For more information about how to restore a tenant in a multi-replica cluster, see [Restore data](600.restore-data/100.preparation-before-recovery.md).

## Procedure

### Step 1: Initiate log archiving

1. Log on to the database as the administrator of the `oracle_test` tenant.

2. Configure the archive destination.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=file:///data/nfs/backup/archive';
   ```

3. Enable log archiving.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM ARCHIVELOG;
   ```

4. Check whether the log archiving status is `DOING`. You can initiate data backup only when the log archiving status is `DOING`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM DBA_OB_ARCHIVELOG\G
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
                        DEST_ID: 1001
                       ROUND_ID: 1
                    INCARNATION: 1
                        DEST_NO: 0
                         STATUS: DOING
                      START_SCN: 1706670992366131000
              START_SCN_DISPLAY: 2024-01-31 11:16:32.366131
                 CHECKPOINT_SCN: 1706670992366131001
         CHECKPOINT_SCN_DISPLAY: 2024-01-31 11:16:32.366131
                     COMPATIBLE: 1
                  BASE_PIECE_ID: 1
                  USED_PIECE_ID: 1
          PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL: 86400000000
                      UNIT_SIZE: 1
                    COMPRESSION: none
                    INPUT_BYTES: 54533925
            INPUT_BYTES_DISPLAY: 52.01MB
                   OUTPUT_BYTES: 54533925
           OUTPUT_BYTES_DISPLAY: 52.01MB
              COMPRESSION_RATIO: 1.00
            DELETED_INPUT_BYTES: 0
    DELETED_INPUT_BYTES_DISPLAY: 0.00MB
           DELETED_OUTPUT_BYTES: 0
   DELETED_OUTPUT_BYTES_DISPLAY: 0.00MB
                        COMMENT:
                           PATH: file:///data/nfs/backup/archive
   1 row in set
   ```

   The query result shows that the value of the log archiving status field `STATUS` is `DOING`.

For more information about log archiving operations and instructions, see [Log archiving](300.log-archive/100.overview-of-log-archive.md).

### Step 2: Initiate data backup

Make sure that the log archiving status is `DOING` before you initiate data backup.

1. Log on to the database as the administrator of the `oracle_test` tenant.

2. Configure the backup destination.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST='file:///data/nfs/backup/data';
   ```

3. Initiate a full data backup.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP DATABASE;
   ```

4. Wait for the data backup to be completed.

   You can query the `DBA_OB_BACKUP_TASKS` view to check whether the data backup task is completed. If the returned task list is empty, the data backup task is completed.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM DBA_OB_BACKUP_TASKS;
   ```

5. View the data backup result.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM DBA_OB_BACKUP_JOB_HISTORY;
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
                JOB_ID: 1
           INCARNATION: 1
         BACKUP_SET_ID: 1
   INITIATOR_TENANT_ID: 1002
      INITIATOR_JOB_ID: 0
    EXECUTOR_TENANT_ID: 1002
       PLUS_ARCHIVELOG: OFF
           BACKUP_TYPE: FULL
             JOB_LEVEL: USER_TENANT
       ENCRYPTION_MODE: NONE
                PASSWD:
       START_TIMESTAMP: 2024-01-31 11:20:59.804836
         END_TIMESTAMP: 2024-01-31 11:23:08.773566
                STATUS: COMPLETED
                RESULT: 0
               COMMENT:
           DESCRIPTION:
                  PATH: file:///data/nfs/backup/data
   1 row in set
   ```

For more information about data backup operations and instructions, see [Data backup](400.data-backup/100.preparation-before-data-backup.md).

### Step 3: Perform physical restore

1. Log on as the `root` user to the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the destination tenant resides.

2. Create the resources required for the destination tenant.

   1. Create a resource unit named `unit_backup`.

      ```sql
      obclient> CREATE RESOURCE UNIT unit_backup MAX_CPU 8, MEMORY_SIZE = '16G', MAX_IOPS 10240, MIN_IOPS=10240;
      ```

   2. Create a resource pool for the destination tenant. We recommend that you create a resource pool with the same specifications as the source tenant if possible, that is, using the same `UNIT_NUM` value as the source tenant.

      ```sql
      obclient> CREATE RESOURCE POOL restore_pool UNIT = 'unit_backup', UNIT_NUM = 1, ZONE_LIST = ('z1');
      ```

3. Initiate a physical restore task to restore data to the `oracle_backup` tenant.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE oracle_backup FROM 'file:///data/nfs/backup/data,file:///data/nfs/backup/archive' WITH 'pool_list=restore_pool&locality=F@z1';
   ```
