# Change the backup destination

After you enable data backup, you can change the backup destination based on your business needs.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the sys tenant or a user tenant as the administrator.

2. Check whether ongoing backup jobs exist. For more information, see [View the data backup progress](500.view-data-backup-progress.md).

   If the query result is not empty, ongoing data backup jobs exist. In this case, you must stop the ongoing backup jobs. For more information, see [Stop a backup job](400.stop-data-backup.md).

3. Reconfigure the backup destination.

   Make sure that the directory where the new backup destination belongs is empty. For information about how to configure a backup destination, see [Preparations](100.preparation-before-data-backup.md).

4. Query the `CDB_OB_BACKUP_PARAMETER` view in the sys tenant or the `DBA_OB_BACKUP_PARAMETER` view in a user tenant to verify whether the new backup destination is successfully configured. For more information, see [View data backup parameter settings](700.parameters-of-data-backup.md).

## What to do next

After the backup destination is changed, you must re-initiate a full data backup. For more information, see [Initiate a full data backup job](200.initiate-full-data-backup.md).
