# Query the backup cleanup history

After a cleanup strategy is configured and automatic cleanup is triggered, expired backup data will be automatically cleaned up based on the strategy. You can query views for the backup cleanup history.

## Query views for the backup cleanup history

1. Log on to the database as an administrator of the sys tenant or a user tenant.

2. Query historical cleanup jobs.

   * Query the historical backup cleanup jobs.

      You can query the `oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_DELETE_JOB_HISTORY` view from the sys tenant for the historical cleanup jobs of all tenants. You can query the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_BACKUP_DELETE_JOB_HISTORY` view from a MySQL tenant or the `sys.DBA_OB_BACKUP_DELETE_JOB_HISTORY` view from an Oracle tenant for the historical cleanup jobs of the current tenant.

      The following example shows how to query the historical cleanup jobs from the sys tenant:

      ```shell
      obclient> SELECT * FROM CDB_OB_BACKUP_DELETE_JOB_HISTORY\G
      *************************** 1. row ***************************
                     TENANT_ID: 1002
                        JOB_ID: 7
                   INCARNATION: 1
           INITIATOR_TENANT_ID: 1002
              INITIATOR_JOB_ID: 7
            EXECUTOR_TENANT_ID: 1002
                          TYPE: DELETE OBSOLETE BACKUP
                     PARAMETER: 2022-05-31 12:09:40.060284
                     JOB_LEVEL: USER_TENANT
               START_TIMESTAMP: 2022-06-01 12:09:53.389512
                 END_TIMESTAMP: 2022-06-01 12:10:36.829576
                        STATUS: COMPLETED
                    TASK_COUNT: 2
            SUCCESS_TASK_COUNT: 2
                        RESULT: 0
                       COMMENT:
      1 row in set
      ```

      According to the query result, the user tenant with the tenant ID `1002` initiated a job for cleaning up expired backup data at `2022-06-01 12:09:53.389512`, and the job was completed at `2022-06-01 12:10:36.829576`. The success rate of the tasks under the job is 100%, which is calculated by using the following formula: `TASK_COUNT/SUCCESS_TASK_COUNT` Ã— 100%. The value of `RESULT` is `0`, indicating that the job was successfully executed.

   * Query historical backup set/back piece cleanup tasks.

      You can query the `oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_DELETE_TASK_HISTORY` view from the sys tenant for the historical cleanup tasks of all tenants. You can query the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_BACKUP_DELETE_TASK_HISTORY` view from a MySQL tenant or the `sys.DBA_OB_BACKUP_DELETE_TASK_HISTORY` view from an Oracle tenant for the historical cleanup tasks of the current tenant.

      The following example shows how to view the historical records of the `backup_set/backup_piece` cleanup tasks from the sys tenant:

      ```shell
      obclient> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_DELETE_TASK_HISTORY\G
      *************************** 1. row ***************************
               TENANT_ID: 1002
                 TASK_ID: 4
             INCARNATION: 1
                  JOB_ID: 7
               TASK_TYPE: BACKUP SET

           END_TIMESTAMP: 2022-06-01 12:09:54.954691

          TOTAL_LS_COUNT: 2
         FINISH_LS_COUNT: 2
                  RESULT: 0
                 COMMENT:

      *************************** 2. row ***************************
               TENANT_ID: 1002
                 TASK_ID: 5
             INCARNATION: 1
                  JOB_ID: 7
               TASK_TYPE: BACKUP PIECE
                      ID: 1
                ROUND_ID: 1
                 DEST_ID: 1001
         START_TIMESTAMP: 2022-06-01 12:09:50.968413
           END_TIMESTAMP: 2022-06-01 12:09:56.283804
                  STATUS: COMPLETED
          TOTAL_LS_COUNT: 2
         FINISH_LS_COUNT: 2
                  RESULT: 0
                 COMMENT:
                    PATH: file:///data/nfs/backup/archive
      2 rows in set
      ```

      According to the query result, the backup file of the data backup with `backup_set_id=1` in the destination `file:///data/nfs/backup/data` was deleted at `2022-06-01 12:09:54.954691`. In the destination `file:///data/nfs/backup/archive`, the backup file of archive logs with `round_id=1/backup_piece_id=1` was deleted at `2022-06-01 12:09:56.283804`. You can query the information about initiated cleanup tasks in the job-level view based on `JOB_ID`.
