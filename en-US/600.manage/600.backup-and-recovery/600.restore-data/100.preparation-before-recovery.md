# Preparations

Before you perform restore, you need to create the resources for the tenant to be restored.

## Considerations

Before you restore data, you must confirm the version of the OceanBase database that hosts the backup data to be restored. OceanBase Database supports only the restore of backup data to OceanBase Database of the same or a later version. For example, if your backup data is from OceanBase Database V4.2.0, it can be restored only to OceanBase Database V4.2.x. You can also restore data from OceanBase Database V4.1.x to V4.2.0.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Create a resource unit.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> CREATE RESOURCE UNIT box_16c96g MAX_CPU 16, MEMORY_SIZE = '5G', MAX_IOPS 10240, MIN_IOPS=10240;
   ```

   For more information about how to create a resource unit, see [Create a tenant](../../200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).

3. Create a resource pool.

   We recommend that you create a resource pool that is homogeneous with the resource pool of the source tenant, namely has the same number of resource units as the resource pool of the source tenant.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> CREATE RESOURCE POOL restore_pool unit = 'box_16c96g', unit_num = 1, zone_list = ('z1','z2','z3');
   ```

   For more information about how to create a resource pool, see [Create a tenant](../../200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).
