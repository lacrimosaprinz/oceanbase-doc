# Preparations

Before you restore data, you need to create resources for the tenant to be restored.

## Considerations

Before you restore data, you must confirm the version of your database that hosts the backup data to be restored. Currently, OceanBase Database only supports restoring backup data from lower versions to the same or higher versions. It does not support reverse restore between minor versions of the same version. For example, if your backup data is from OceanBase Database V4.2.0, it can only be restored to V4.2.x. Similarly, backup data in OceanBase Database V4.1.x can be restored to OceanBase Database V4.2.0.

## Preparations

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Create a resource unit.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> CREATE RESOURCE UNIT box_16c96g MAX_CPU 16, MEMORY_SIZE = '2G', MAX_IOPS 10240, MIN_IOPS=10240;
   ```

   For more information about how to create a resource unit, see [Create a tenant](../../200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).

3. Create a resource pool.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> CREATE RESOURCE POOL restore_pool unit = 'box_16c96g', unit_num = 1, zone_list = ('z1','z2','z3');
   ```

   For more information about how to create a resource pool, see [Create a tenant](../../200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).
