# Cancel physical restore

During the restore of a tenant, you can execute the `ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL RESTORE` statement to stop the restore and delete the tenant to be restored.

## Procedure

1. Log on as the `root` user to the `sys` tenant of the cluster to which the tenant to be restored belongs.

2. Execute the following statement to immediately cancel the restore and delete the tenant to be restored:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL RESTORE tenant_name;
   ```

   Here, `tenant_name` is the name of the tenant for which data is to be restored.
