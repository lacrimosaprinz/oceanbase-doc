# Replay logs to a standby tenant

After a restore succeeded, the restored tenant is a standby tenant. You can execute the `RECOVER` statement to proceed to log replay from the log archive source specified during the restore.

## Background information

Physical restore is associated with the Physical Standby Database feature. A physically restored tenant serves as a standby tenant. You can convert it into the primary tenant based on your business needs.

## Prerequisites

The restore succeeded. For more information about how to view the restore result, see [Query the restore result](../600.restore-data/500.view-the-restore-history.md).

## Replay logs to a standby tenant from the sys tenant

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statement to replay logs.



   * Replay logs to the specified timestamp.

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY TENANT tenant_name UNTIL TIME='timestamp';
      ```

   * Replay logs to the specified system change number (SCN).

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY TENANT tenant_name UNTIL SCN=scn;
      ```

   * Continuously replay logs from the archive source without specifying the end point.

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY TENANT tenant_name UNTIL UNLIMITED;
      ```

     <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>This statement allows you to specify only one standby tenant at a time. To perform this operation on multiple tenants, execute this statement repeatedly. </p>
     </main>

3. (Optional) Execute the following statement to cancel log replay for a standby tenant.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY TENANT tenant_name CANCEL;
   ```

## Initiate log replay from a standby tenant



1. Log on to the database as an administrator of the standby tenant.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>The administrator user is <code>root</code> for a MySQL tenant and <code>SYS</code> for an Oracle tenant. </p>
   </main>

2. Execute the following statement to replay logs.



   * Replay logs to the specified timestamp.

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY UNTIL TIME='timestamp';
      ```

   * Replay logs to the specified SCN.

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY UNTIL SCN=scn;
      ```

   * Continuously replay logs from the archive source without specifying the end point.

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY UNTIL UNLIMITED;
      ```

     <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>This statement allows you to specify only one standby tenant at a time. To perform this operation on multiple tenants, execute this statement repeatedly. </p>
     </main>

3. (Optional) Execute the following statement to cancel log replay for a standby tenant.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY CANCEL;
   ```
