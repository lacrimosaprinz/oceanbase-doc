# Preparations

An auxiliary tenant is required to restore a table. Therefore, before you restore a table, you must create a resource pool for the auxiliary tenant in the cluster where the destination tenant resides.

OceanBase Database restores a specified table from backup data to an existing tenant. This tenant can be the same as the one where the original table resides, or it can be a tenant within the same cluster, or even a tenant in a different cluster. The following figure shows the overall table restore process. Firstly, data is restored to the specified point in time in the auxiliary tenant. Then, the specified table is imported from the auxiliary tenant to the destination tenant. Finally, the auxiliary tenant is cleared. Similar to the concept of an auxiliary instance in Oracle Database, an auxiliary tenant consumes additional computing and storage resources during the table restore process.

## Preparations before restore

1. Log on as the `root` user to the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the destination tenant resides.

2. Create a resource unit.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> CREATE RESOURCE UNIT box_16c96g MAX_CPU 16, MEMORY_SIZE = '2G', MAX_IOPS 10240, MIN_IOPS=10240;
   ```

   For more information about how to create a resource unit, see [Create a tenant](../../200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).

3. Create a resource pool.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> CREATE RESOURCE POOL restore_pool unit = 'box_16c96g', unit_num = 1, zone_list = ('z1','z2','z3');
   ```

   For more information about how to create a resource pool, see [Create a tenant](../../200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).
