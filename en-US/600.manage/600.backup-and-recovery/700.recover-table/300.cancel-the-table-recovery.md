# Cancel table restore

During the restore of a table, you can execute the `ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL RECOVER TABLE` statement to stop the restore. This statement cancels all table restore tasks in the specified tenant, but does not release the resource pool that was created for the restore.

## Procedure

1. Log on as the `root` user to the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the destination tenant resides.

2. Execute the following statement to immediately cancel the restore:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL RECOVER TABLE dest_tenant_name;
   ```

   Here, `dest_tenant_name` specifies the destination tenant to which the table is to be restored.


## What to do next

After you cancel the table restore operation, you can execute the following statement in the cluster where the destination tenant resides to manually release the resource pool that was created for the auxiliary tenant before the restore:

```sql
DROP RESOURCE POOL restore_pool;
```

Here, `restore_pool` specifies the name of the resource pool created for the auxiliary tenant before the restore.

For more information about how to drop a resource pool, see [Drop a resource pool](../../200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/1500.resource-pool-management/600.delete-resource-pool.md).
