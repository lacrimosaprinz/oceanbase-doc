# View the table restore progress

After the table restore statement is executed, you can view the table restore progress.

## Procedure

1. Log on as the `root` user to the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the destination tenant resides.

2. View the table restore progress.

   You can query the `CDB_OB_RECOVER_TABLE_JOBS` view in the sys tenant to check the table restore progress.

   ```sql
   obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_RECOVER_TABLE_JOBS\G
   ```

   A sample query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   *************************** 1. row ***************************

                     JOB_ID: 1

   ```

   This view records the restore parameter information entered by the user during the restore process, as well as the restore results and other related information.

   The entire process of table restore includes data restore in the auxiliary tenant and data import across tenants. The `CDB_OB_RECOVER_TABLE_JOBS` view contains two job records: one for the `sys` tenant and one for the target user tenant itself. The records in this view are as follows:

   * For the `sys` tenant, the job record tracks the progress of table restore for the target user tenant. When the entire table restore job for the target tenant is completed, the job ends.

   * For the target user tenant itself, the job record includes the progress of data restore in the auxiliary and the progress of table import. When both the data restore in the auxiliary tenant and the table import are completed, the job ends.

   In the query result, `AUX_RECOVER$1692106995896258` indicates the auxiliary tenant, `backup_tenant` indicates the destination user tenant, and the table to be restored is `TEST`.`T1`. `STATUS` indicates the current stage of the table restore job. Valid values of `STATUS` are as follows:

   * `PREPARE`: The job is being initialized.
   * `RECOVERING`: The destination tenant is being restored. This status is displayed only for the `sys` tenant.
   * `RESTORE_AUX_TENANT`: Data is being restored in the auxiliary tenant.
   * `PRECHECK_IMPORT`: Pre-import check is being performed.
   * `GEN_IMPORT_JOB`: The import job is being initialized.
   * `IMPORTING`: The table is being imported.
   * `CANCELING`: The job is being canceled.
   * `COMPLETED`: The job is completed.
   * `FAILED`: The job failed.

   If `STATUS` is `COMPLETED` in the view, the table restore is completed. For more information about the fields in the `CDB_OB_RECOVER_TABLE_JOBS` view, see [Views related to table restore](700.views-of-the-table-recovery.md).

3. Before table restore is completed, you can view the progress of data restore in the auxiliary tenant or the progress of data import to the destination tenant based on the stage of the table restore job.

   * To view the progress of data restore in the auxiliary tenant, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_RESTORE_PROGRESS\G
      ```

      The restore of an auxiliary tenant is the same as that of the physical restore of a tenant. For more information about how to view the progress of physical restore, see [View the physical restore progress](../600.restore-data/400.view-the-restore-progress.md).

   * To view the progress of data import to the destination tenant, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_IMPORT_TABLE_JOBS\G
      ```

      A sample query result is as follows:

      ```shell

      In the query result, `STATUS` is `IMPORT_TABLE`, indicating that the `TEST`.`T1` table is being imported. During table import, you can also view the import details of each table.

      ```sql
      obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_IMPORT_TABLE_TASKS\G
      ```
