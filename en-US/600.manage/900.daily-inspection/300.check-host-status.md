# Check the host status

This topic describes how to check the host status on the CLI.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The output of the commands in this topic may vary slightly based on the system configuration and version. </p>
</main>

## Check whether the host is online

You can use the following commands to check whether a host is online.

* `ping`: checks the network connectivity of a host. The command sends a network probe packet to the host for a response to determine whether a host is reachable.

   ```shell
   ping <host_name_or_ip_address>
   ```

   Here, `<host_name_or_ip_address>` is the name or IP address of the host. If the host is online, a series of responses are returned from the host. If the host is not online, an error message or no response is displayed.

* `ssh`: tries to remotely log on to the host over the SSH protocol. If the connection is successful, the host is online.

   ```shell
   ssh <user>@<host_name_or_ip_address>
   ```

   Here, `<user>` is the user name used to log on to the host, and `<host_name_or_ip_address>` is the name or IP address of the host. If the host is successfully connected, a logon prompt for the host is displayed.

## Check the CPU information

`mpstat`: returns a series of parameters about CPU usage for multi-core CPU monitoring and reporting.

```shell
mpstat
```

The parameters returned by the `mpstat` command are described as follows:

* CPU: the number of the CPU.
* %usr: the percentage of CPU time for the execution of userspace processes.
* %nice: the percentage of CPU time for the execution of user-mode processes with a Nice value.
* % sys: the percentage of CPU time for the execution of core-mode threads.
* % iowait: the percentage of CPU time for I/O waiting.
* %irq: the percentage of CPU time consumed by hardware interrupts.
* %soft: the percentage of CPU time consumed by software interrupts.
* %steal: the percentage of CPU time occupied by a virtualized environment, such as a virtual machine.
* %guest: the percentage of user tasks that are running virtual CPUs in a virtualized environment.
* %idle: the percentage of CPU idle time.

Here is an example:

```shell
[admin@xxx /home/admin]
$mpstat
Linux 3.10.0-327.ali2019.alios7.x86_64 (xxx)      09/13/2023      _x86_64_
     (64 CPU)

10:25:42 AM  CPU    %usr   %nice    %sys %iowait    %irq   %soft  %steal  %guest  %gnice   %idle
10:25:42 AM  all    8.36    0.00    2.38    0.04    0.00    0.18    0.00    0.00    0.00   89.04
```

## Check the memory information

`free -h`: returns parameters about the memory usage of the system.

```shell
free -h
```

The parameters returned by the `free -h` command are described as follows:

* total: the total amount of the physical memory (RAM).
* used: the amount of physical memory that has been used.
* free: the amount of free physical memory.
* shared: the amount of physical memory shared by multiple processes.
* buff/cache: the amount of physical memory for the cache and buffer.
* available: the current amount of available physical memory, that is, the remaining available memory, which is the sum of free and buff/cache.

* Swap: the usage of swap partitions.
* total: the total amount of swap partitions.
* used: the amount of the used swap partitions.
* free: the amount of the idle swap partitions.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The <code>-h</code> option displays the memory size in a more user-friendly way for easier reading. </p>
</main>

Here is an example:

```shell
[admin@xxx /home/admin]
$free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           503G        255G        7.2G        4.2M        240G        238G
Swap:            0B          0B          0B
```

## Check the disk information

`df`: returns the disk usage and information about the path, partition disk size, used size, available size, usage, and mounted directories.

```shell
df [-h] [dir_name]
```

The `-h` parameter specifies to display the disk sizes in GB. The `dir_name` parameter specifies to display the total disk size of a directory.

The output includes the following information:

* Filesystem: the path or device name of the file system.
* Size: the total size of the partition disk.
* Used: the size of the disk space used.
* Available: the available disk size.
* Use%: the usage of the disk space.
* Mounted on: the mount directory.

Here is an example:

```shell
[root@xxx /home/admin]# df -h /data/1
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
-               196G  168G   19G  91% /data/1
```
