Check the OBServer node status
===================================

This topic describes how to check the OBServer node status.

Check the OBServer node status on the host
----------------------------------------

1. Log on to the host on which the target OBServer node is located.

2. Run the following command on the command line interface (CLI) to check the observer process:

   ```shell
   ps -ef |grep observer
   root       6136      0 99 11:23 ?        08:53:50 ./bin/observer
   root      20514  19521  0 16:09 pts/25   00:00:00 grep --color=auto observer
   ```

Check the OBServer node status in the relevant view
---------------------------------------

```sql
obclient> SELECT status FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_SERVERS;
+--------+
| status |
+--------+
| active |
| active |
+--------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

* If the returned result for an OBServer node is `active`, the OBServer node is running properly.

* If the returned result for an OBServer node is `inactive`, the OBServer node is offline.

* If the returned result for an OBServer node is `deleting`, the OBServer node is being deleted.
