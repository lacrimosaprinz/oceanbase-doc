Different request links are available for different requests. A complete request link consists of multiple request procedures. In OceanBase Database, an internal processing procedure is defined as a span. A request link can be understood as a tree structure that contains parent span nodes and child span nodes. This type of information is recorded in trace logs. Parent and child nodes are associated based on `parent_id` and `id`. In trace logs, the information about executed SQL statements during each request procedure is tagged. Details about the current operation are recorded by using different tags. Spans and tags are recorded in trace logs to help O&M engineers understand the internal processing logic of the database and locate issues. 

The following sections describe the three parts of an entire access link. 

## Client

Applications connect to OceanBase Database by using the OBClient or JDBC driver. 

Spans related to the client are `obclient` and `JDBC`. 

* `obclient`: Applications access the database by using the OBClient. 

* `JDBC`: Applications access the database by using the JDBC driver. 

Client-related tags are `command_name` and `client_ip`. The tags of the OBClient and JDBC driver are consistent. 

* `command_name` marks requests of different types such as text requests, prepare requests, and execute requests. 

* `client_ip` specifies the IP address and port of the OBClient that sends the request. 

## ODP

This phase involves three levels of spans. The span level here corresponds to the level variable in the trace-related function of dbms_monitor. 

* Level 1

   Two types of spans are defined: `ob_proxy` and `ob_proxy_server_process_req`. 
   * `ob_proxy` indicates the total time consumed by OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) to process an SQL request. This period begins from the time when a database request is sent, to the time when data processing is finished, and finally to the time when a result is returned, excluding the frontend driver layer of OceanBase Database. 

   * `ob_proxy_server_process_req` indicates the time consumed by ODP to process an SQL request and the network overhead of the request. 

* Level 2

   Two types of spans are defined: `ob_proxy_server_response_read` and `ob_proxy_cluster_resource_create`. 
   * `ob_proxy_server_response_read` indicates the time consumed in reading the response. 

   * `ob_proxy_cluster_resource_create` indicates the time consumed by ODP to prepare cluster resources in the request forwarding phase. 

* Level 3

   Four types of spans are defined: `ob_proxy_partition_location_lookup` , `ob_proxy_do_OBServer_open`, `ob_proxy_client_response_write`, and `ob_proxy_server_request_write`. 
   * `ob_proxy_partition_location_lookup` indicates the time consumed by ODP to obtain the partition location for routing in the request forwarding phase. 

   * `ob_proxy_do_observer_open` indicates the time consumed by ODP to select an OBServer node or establish a connection in the request forwarding phase. 

   * `ob_proxy_client_response_write` indicates the time consumed by ODP to forward the response to the client after it receives the response from the OBServer node. 

   * `ob_proxy_server_request_write` indicates the time consumed by ODP to forward the client request to the OBServer node. 

## OBServer

### Spans

OBServer classifies the received requests into text SQL statements, preprocess statements, and stored procedures. The three types of requests contain transactions, internal SQL requests, and access requests stored in the database. 

The following figure shows the access links for different request types and the relationship between parent and child span nodes. For example, the parent span of the `mpquery_single_stmt` span is `com_query_entry`, and the child span of the `com_query_entry` span is `mpquery_single_stmt`.
