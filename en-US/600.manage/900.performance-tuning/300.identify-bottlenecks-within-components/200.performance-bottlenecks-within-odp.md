# ODP performance bottlenecks

OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) provides a range of internal tables and system logs for you to locate performance bottlenecks. You can analyze ODP behaviors by using audit logs, slow logs, and statistical logs.

The following figure shows the major types of possible ODP exceptions:

![Possible ODP exceptions](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.1/EN_US/600.manage/900.performance-tuning/possible-ODP-exceptions.png)

The exceptions are described as follows:

* **Connection establishment failure**

   This error indicates that the application system failed to connect to an OBServer node. Possible causes include: overloading of the database system due to a large number of requests, exceptions of the application system, such as a full GC, an NIC error of the application server, and incorrect database configuration at the application layer, and a network exception between the application server and the OBServer node. This type of errors may be reported by an application, ODP, and OBServer node.

* **SQL execution exceptions**

   * Returned errors: Explicit error codes are returned from the backend database system. You can troubleshoot the faulty OBServer nodes based on the error codes.

   * Slow execution: You must first locate the component that consumes an unusually long period of time and perform in-depth troubleshooting.

   * Disconnection: You must first locate the component that disconnects from a link and perform in-depth troubleshooting.

ODP provides various logs for troubleshooting.

* Error logs

   Error logs are recorded in the `obproxy_error.log` file. It records requests that are incorrectly executed, ODP errors, and errors returned from OBServer nodes.

* Audit logs

   Audit logs are recorded in the `obproxy_digest.log` file. It records the requests whose execution time exceeds the value specified for the `query_digest_time_threshold` parameter (which defaults to `100ms`), and requests with incorrect responses.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The <code>query_digest_time_threshold</code> parameter specifies the threshold of request execution duration in the range of [0s,30d]. If the execution duration of a request exceeds the threshold, a log is recorded in the <code>obproxy_digest.log</code> file. </p>
    </main>

* Slow logs

   Slow logs are recorded in the `obproxy_slow.log` file. It records the requests whose execution time exceeds the value specified for the `slow_query_time_threshold` parameter. The default threshold is 500 ms.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The <code>slow_query_time_threshold</code> parameter specifies the execution duration threshold of slow requests in the range of [0s,30d]. If the execution duration of a request exceeds the threshold, a log is recorded in the <code>obproxy_slow.log</code> file. </p>
    </main>

* Statistical logs

   Statistical logs are recorded in the `obproxy_stat.log` file at the interval specified by the `monitor_stat_dump_interval` parameter. The default interval is 1 minute. Statistical logs allow you to view the execution of SQL statements in ODP within the last minute.

* Primary logs

   Primary logs are recorded in the `obproxy.log` file and are classified into the following four levels: DEBUG, TRACE, INFO, and ERROR. The log level is specified by the `syslog_level` parameter. You can obtain all logs of a session for further troubleshooting by using the `trace_id` field.

The `obproxy.log` file records information in detail, including the duration of each sub-step. To search for slow SQL queries, use the keyword `Slow Query`. Here is an example:

)
```

The `request_total_time_us` parameter indicates the total time spent by ODP on processing the request. The `server_process_request_time_us` parameter indicates the total duration of request transmission from ODP to the OBServer node and request processing on the OBServer node. Based on these logs, you can learn about the time consumption of each execution step of slow SQL statements, which makes SQL troubleshooting easier.
