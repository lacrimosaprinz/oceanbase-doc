# Overview

In OceanBase Database V4.0, statistics can be collected both manually and automatically.

Note that statistics are not collected during major compactions in OceanBase Database V4.0 and later. Unless otherwise specified, the statistics collection methods are the same in MySQL mode and Oracle mode of OceanBase Database. This is to shorten the learning curve of new users.
