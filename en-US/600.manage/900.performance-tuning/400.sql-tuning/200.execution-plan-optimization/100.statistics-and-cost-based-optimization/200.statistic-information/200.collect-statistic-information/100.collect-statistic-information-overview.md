# Overview

In OceanBase Database V4.0, statistics can be collected both manually and automatically.

It is important to note that, starting from OceanBase Database V4.0, statistics are not collected during major compactions. Unless otherwise specified, the statistics collection methods are the same in both the MySQL mode and Oracle mode of OceanBase Database. This is to shorten the learning curve of new users.
