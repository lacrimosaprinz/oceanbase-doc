# Overview

In addition to collecting statistics, the `DBMS_STATS` package also provides statistics management capabilities. The OceanBase Database optimizer, based on the native statistics management features of Oracle's `DBMS_STATS` package, offers a rich set of statistics management features in both Oracle and MySQL modes of OceanBase Database (unless specifically stated, the usage is the same by default in both modes). The optimizer in OceanBase Database V4.0 mainly includes features such as statistics deletion, configuration, import and export of statistics, locking of statistics, management of historical versions of statistics, as well as configuration of statistics collection strategies (preferences).
