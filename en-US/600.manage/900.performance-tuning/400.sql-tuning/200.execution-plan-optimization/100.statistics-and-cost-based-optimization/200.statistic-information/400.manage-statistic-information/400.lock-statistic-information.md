# Lock statistics

You can lock statistics to prevent them from being updated and keep them stable. For example, when you want to keep the table statistics unchanged after you collect statistics on a table with stable data, you can lock the table statistics.

The `DBMS_STATS` package provides the following procedures for locking or unlocking statistics:

* `lock_table_stats`: locks statistics on a table.
* `lock_partition_stats`: locks statistics on a partition.
* `lock_schema_stats`: locks statistics on all tables in a schema.
* `unlock_table_stats`: unlocks the statistics of a table.
* `unlock_partition_stats`: unlocks statistics on a partition.
* `unlock_schema_stats`: unlocks statistics on all tables in a schema.

Note that a native Oracle database supports three types of locks: `ALL`, `DATA`, and `CACHE`, and the OceanBase Database optimizer supports only `ALL`. If you lock statistics on a table and a partition, you must unlock statistics on the table and partition at the same time.

```
# Lock the table-level statistics on the T_PART table and statistics on the P0 partition under the TEST user.
call dbms_stats.lock_table_stats('TEST', 'T_PART');
call dbms_stats.lock_partition_stats('TEST', 'T_PART', 'P0');

# Unlock the table-level statistics on the T_PART table and statistics on the P0 partition under the TEST user.
call dbms_stats.unlock_table_stats('TEST', 'T_PART');
call dbms_stats.unlock_partition_stats('TEST', 'T_PART', 'P0');
```
