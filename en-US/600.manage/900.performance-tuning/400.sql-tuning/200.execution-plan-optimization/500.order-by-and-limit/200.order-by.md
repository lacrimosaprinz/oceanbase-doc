# SORT assignment and optimization

When a query contains a `LIMIT` clause, whether the generated execution plan contains a blocking operator can significantly impact performance. `SORT`, as a common blocking operator, is included in the query when an `ORDER BY` clause is used or when the generated plan requires the assignment of operators based on sorting algorithms (such as `MERGE DISTINCT`, `MERGE GROUP BY`, and `MERGE JOIN`). In these cases, the system attempts to assign `SORT` operators to obtain an intermediate result set sorted according to the specified sort key. To avoid unnecessary `SORT` operators and fully utilize already sorted intermediate result sets, the optimizer maintains certain sequence-related information and performs optimizations when attempting to assign `SORT` operators.


## Order in a plan tree

In an execution plan, the input of an operator may be sorted. For base table scans, the order comes from indexed columns. For other operators, this order may come from the output order of child operators. Different from the output order explicitly required by `ORDER BY`, the input order required by most operators that depend on sorting are adjustable, and can be inherited by the output of the operators. By optimizing the order used for operators that depend on sorting, the optimizer can avoid unnecessary sorts.

When the optimizer determines the order for an operator that depends on sorting, it checks the existing input order and the order that may be required later. For example, in the following query, a `MERGE GROUP BY` operator is assigned for the `GROUP BY` clause, and the optimizer can swap the positions in `c1, c2` and change the sorting direction of each column.

* In the `Q2_1_1` query, the use of the `idx` index produces the `c1, c2` order, which avoids assigning a `SORT` operator for `order by c1, c2`.
* Compared with `Q2_1_1`, the `Q2_1_2` query has a different `order by` clause and uses the primary key. The `MERGE GROUP BY` operator directly uses the order required by `order by c2, c1` as the input order for the merge, and a `SORT` operator is assigned below the `MERGE GROUP BY` operator.
* Compared with `Q2_1_2`, the `Q2_1_3` query does not use the primary key. A plan that contains a `MERGE GROUP BY` operator is generated based on cost analysis. The `MERGE GROUP BY` operator can directly use the order of `c1, c2` produced by the `idx` index, and a `SORT` operator is assigned for `order by c2, c1` after the merge.

create table t1(c1 int, c2 int, c3 int, c4 int, pk int primary key);

## Optimize SORT assignment

When the optimizer tries to assign a `SORT` operator to obtain the expected order, if the output of a child operator is sorted, the optimizer checks the output order, which is also the input order of the parent operator, and other related information to see whether the order meets the expectation. The following three queries all contain an `ORDER BY` clause that requires the final result to be sorted. However, because the order provided by the index or primary key matches the order expected by this clause, the optimizer finally does not need to assign a `SORT` operator.

* `Q2_2_1`: The `idx` index provides the `(c1, c2, c3)` order, which matches the output order expected by `order by c1, c2`.
* `Q2_2_2`: The `idx` index provides the `(c1, c2, c3)` order, which matches the output order expected by `order by c2` due to the inclusion of the `c1 = 4` predicate.
* `Q2_2_3`: The primary key provides the `(pk)` order. Due to the uniqueness of the primary key, the input order matches the output order expected by `order by pk, c3, c2, c1`.

```sql
create table t1(c1 int, c2 int, c3 int, c4 int, pk int primary key);
create index idx on t1(c1, c2, c3);

Q2_2_1: select /*+index(t idx)*/ * from t1 t order by c1, c2;
Q2_2_2: select /*+index(t idx)*/ * from t1 t where c1 = 4 order by c2;
Q2_2_3: select /*+index(t primary)*/ * from t1 t order by pk, c3, c2, c1;

Execution plan for Q2_2_1:
=======================================
|ID|OPERATOR  |NAME  |EST. ROWS|COST  |
---------------------------------------
|0 |TABLE SCAN|t(idx)|76557    |216994|
=======================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t.c1], [t.c2], [t.c3], [t.c4], [t.pk]), filter(nil), rowset=256,
      access([t.pk], [t.c1], [t.c2], [t.c3], [t.c4]), partitions(p0)
```

For sorts that cannot be eliminated, the optimizer optimizes the sort columns before assigning a `SORT` operator.

**Prefix sorting**

If a `SORT` operator must be assigned, when the input order of the operator matches part of the expected order, the optimizer performs prefix sorting to utilize part of the input order.

In the following query, after the `idx` index is used, the output order of the `TABLE SCAN` operator is `(c1, c2, c3)`. When the optimizer performs prefix sorting, data in `c1` returned by `TABLE SCAN` is sorted only by `pk`.

```sql
Q2_2_4:
select /*+index(t idx)*/ c1 from t1 t order by c1, pk;
=======================================
|ID|OPERATOR   |NAME  |EST. ROWS|COST |
---------------------------------------
|0 |SORT       |      |76557    |18874|
|1 | TABLE SCAN|t(idx)|76557    |5319 |
=======================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t.c1]), filter(nil), rowset=256,
			sort_keys([t.c1, ASC], [t.pk, ASC]), prefix_pos(1)
  1 - output([t.pk], [t.c1]), filter(nil), rowset=256,
      access([t.pk], [t.c1]), partitions(p0)
```

**Simplify sort columns**

The optimizer can simplify sort columns, thus reducing the number of the involved columns. The following methods are available:

* Make use of equality conditions:

   ```sql
   select c1 from t1 t where c3 = 1 and c2 = c1 order by c3, c2, c1;
   ```

   For the preceding query, the `c3 = 1` and `c2 = c1` conditions can be used for simplification, and the rows returned are finally sorted by `c2`.

* Make use of the primary key or a unique index:

   ```sql
   select c1 from t1 t order by c1, pk, c3, c2;
   ```

   For the preceding query, `pk` is the primary key, and the rows returned are finally sorted by `c1` and `pk`.
