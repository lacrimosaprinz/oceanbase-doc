# Optimization in ORDER BY + LIMIT scenarios

To optimize the performance of a query that contains the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses, the first choice is to generate a streaming execution plan to reduce unnecessary data reads or processing. When a blocking operator must be assigned or there exist scenarios that cause high overhead, the optimizer can make use of the `LIMIT` clause to reduce unnecessary overhead in execution.

## Eliminate sorting

For a simple single-table query that contains the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses, you can create a composite index to eliminate sorting while using the index for fast scanning. This implements a streaming plan and avoids scanning a large number of rows that meet the filter conditions.

```sql
Q3_1_1:
create table t1(c1 int, c2 int, c3 int, c4 int, pk int primary key);
create index idx on t1(c1, c2, c3);
select * from t1 where c1 = 1 and c3 > 0 order by c2 limit 10;
```

For the `Q3_1_1` query, a query range can be extracted from the equality condition `c1 = 1` for a fast index scan. Due to the equality condition on `c1`, the scan on the `idx` index returns a result set sorted by `c2`. After 10 rows are scanned, the execution of the plan is completed in advance.

Note that the `Q3_1_1` query has a `c3 > 0` predicate. If you create an index based on the `(c1, c3, c2)` order, the query range can be directly extracted from the index for `c3 > 0` filtering, but the result set is not sorted by `c2`. When the `c3 > 0` predicate is highly selective, the elimination of sorting for a streaming plan and reduced number of rows to scan basically do not bring any performance improvement. In this case, the use of `idx(c1, c2, c3)` only makes the plan unable to fully utilize the selectivity of `c3 > 0`.

## Reduce scanning and computing overhead

When a query on a wide table or a table with LOB columns contains the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses, the optimizer uses the late materialization strategy to reduce the number of rows to scan.

For the following query `Q3_2_1`, both the filter column and the sort column are included in the `idx` index. The execution engine first scans the sort column, filter column, and primary key based on the `idx` index, performs a sort to determine the rows to return, and then scans the primary table by primary key to return the qualifying rows with all columns. For a complex query that contains the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses, you can also rewrite the query by using the same strategy.

In the `Q3_2_2` query, `no_use_late_materialization` prohibits late materialization. In this case, the execution engine has to access all rows that meet the filter condition in the primary table by index primary key.

```sql
Q3_2_1:
create table t1(c1 int, c2 int, c3 int, c4 int, pk int primary key);
create index idx on t1(c1, c2, c3);
select /*+index(t idx) */ * from t1 t where c1 > 0 order by c2 limit 10;
