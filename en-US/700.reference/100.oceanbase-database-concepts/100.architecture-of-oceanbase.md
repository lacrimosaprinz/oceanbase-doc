# Architecture of OceanBase Database

OceanBase Database adopts a shared-nothing architecture, where each node is equal to each other. That is, each node has its own SQL engine, storage engine, and transaction engine, and runs on a cluster of ordinary PC servers. OceanBase Database provides core features such as high scalability, high availability, high performance, cost-effectiveness, and strong compatibility with mainstream databases.

An OceanBase cluster consists of multiple nodes. These nodes are distributed across several zones, with each node belonging to one zone. A zone is a logical concept that represents a group of nodes that share similar hardware availability in the cluster. Its meaning varies depending on the deployment mode. For example, in a scenario where the cluster is deployed in one IDC, nodes in a zone may belong to the same rack or the same switch. If the cluster is deployed across IDCs, each zone can correspond to one IDC. Each zone has two attributes: IDC and region. These attributes specify the IDC in which the zone is located and the region to which the IDC belongs. Typically, the region refers to the city where the IDC is located. The IDC and region attributes of a zone should reflect the actual deployment circumstances to ensure the proper functioning of automatic disaster recovery mechanisms and optimization strategies within the cluster. To meet different high availability requirements of businesses, the OceanBase cluster offers various deployment modes. For more information, see [High availability architecture](1000.high-data-reliability-and-availability/100.high-availability-architecture/100.highly-available-architecture-overview.md).

In OceanBase Database, data in a table can be horizontally divided into multiple shards based on a specified partitioning rule. Each shard is known as a table partition or simply a partition. A row of data belongs to and only exists in one partition. The partitioning rule is specified by the user when creating a table and can include types such as hash, range, list, and also supports sub-partitioning. For example, an order table in a transaction database can be initially divided into several partitions based on user ID, and then each partition can be further divided into several subpartitions based on months. In a subpartition table, each subpartition is a physical partition, while the partition is merely a logical concept. Multiple partitions of a table can be distributed across multiple nodes within a zone. Each physical partition has a storage layer object, called a tablet, for storing ordered data records.

When you modify data in a tablet, the system records redo logs to the corresponding log stream to ensure data persistence. Each log stream serves multiple tablets on the local node. To protect data and ensure service continuity when a node fails, each log stream and tablet have multiple replicas. Typically, multiple replicas of a log stream or tablet are distributed across zones. You can modify only one of the replicas, which is referred to as a leader. Other replicas are referred to as followers. Data consistency is ensured between the leader and followers based on the Multi-Paxos protocol. If the node where the leader is located is down, a follower is elected as the new leader to continue to provide services.

Each node in the cluster runs an observer process, which contains multiple operating system threads. All nodes provide the same features. Each observer process accesses data of partitions on the node in which it runs, and parses and executes SQL statements routed to the node. The observer processes communicate with each other by using the TCP/IP protocol. In addition, each observer process listens to connection requests from external applications, establishes connections and database sessions, and provides database services. For more information about observer processes, see [Threads](1200.observer-node-architecture/300.observer-thread-model/100.thread-introduction.md).

OceanBase Database provides the unique multi-tenant feature to simplify the management of multiple business databases deployed on a large scale and reduce resource costs. In an OceanBase cluster, you can create multiple isolated database instances, which are referred to as tenants. From the perspective of applications, each tenant is a separate database. In addition, you can create a tenant in MySQL- or Oracle-compatible mode. After your application is connected to a MySQL-compatible tenant, you can create users and databases in the tenant. The user experience is similar to that with a standalone MySQL database. In the same way, after your application is connected to an Oracle-compatible tenant, you can create schemas and manage roles in the tenant. The user experience is similar to that with a standalone Oracle database. After a new cluster is initialized, a sys tenant is created. The sys tenant is a MySQL-compatible tenant that stores the metadata of the cluster.

To isolate the resources of each tenant, each observer process can have multiple virtual containers known as resource units (UNIT) that belong to different tenants. The resource units of each tenant across multiple nodes form a resource pool. A resource unit includes CPU and memory resources.

To shield applications from internal details such as the distribution of partitions and replicas in OceanBase Database and make accessing a distributed database as simple as accessing a standalone database, we provide the OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) service. Applications do not directly connect to the OBServer nodes, but instead connects to ODP, which then forwards SQL requests to the appropriate OBServer node. ODP is a stateless service, and multiple ODP nodes provide a unified network address to the application through network load balancing (SLB).
