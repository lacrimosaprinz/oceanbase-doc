# Overview

Security is one of the top priorities for a database. A database management system is required to prevent unauthorized use of the database and protect the files and data of the database. This topic describes the security system of OceanBase Database.

Data is the most important asset of an enterprise and is often the target of various threats. In addition, data breaches can cause extensive damages.

As the final data carrier, OceanBase Database prioritizes data security and provides a security feature that protects your data in terms of network transmission, user authentication, operation audit, storage security, and high availability.

The security system of OceanBase Database provides identity authentication, access control, data encryption, monitoring and alerts, and security audit.

OceanBase Database supports a full range of enterprise-level security features to ensure data security. The security system of OceanBase Database has the following features:

* Authentication

   OceanBase Database supports identity authentication and user and role management to improve database security. For more information, see [Identity authentication](../1100.database-security/200.identity-authentication.md).

* Access control

   OceanBase Database manages user access to data by defining system and object privileges and roles. For more information, see [Access control](../1100.database-security/300.access-control.md).

* Data encryption

   OceanBase Database supports encrypting data for transmission and storage. OceanBase Database supports end-to-end data encryption at the transport layer. In addition, OceanBase Database supports transparent encryption of stored data to maximize data security even when the storage medium is lost. For more information, see [Data transmission encryption](../1100.database-security/400.transmission-encryption.md) and [Data storage encryption](../1100.database-security/500.data-storage-encryption.md).

* Monitoring and alerting

   OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides the monitoring and alerting service in OceanBase Database. OCP is a management platform designed for OceanBase Database. It provides features such as resource and container management, cluster and instance lifecycle management, APIs, and real-time computing-based performance monitoring. For more information, see [Monitoring and alerting](../1100.database-security/600.monitoring-and-alerting.md).

* AuditTrail

   OceanBase Database audits user behaviors and records all user operations. OceanBase Database also supports the audit of database objects. Audit information is generated when you access data to ensure that data access behaviors are correctly recorded. For more information, see [Security audit](../1100.database-security/700.security-audit.md).
