# Data transmission encryption

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end communications security over networks. In addition to TCP, OceanBase Database also supports the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and TLS protocols to implement communication encryption.

The following figure shows the architecture of OceanBase Database, which consists of three parts.

![Transmission encryption](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.1/EN_US/700.reference/100.oceanbase-database-concepts/%E5%86%85%E6%A0%B830.png)

The three parts communicate over the following two protocols:

* MySQL protocol: The data link layer communicates with the driver layer and the database layer over the extended MySQL protocol.

* OB-RPC protocol: The inherent RPC protocol of OBServer nodes is used for communication between OBServer nodes and between OBServer nodes and components such as liboblog or ob_admin.

The data link layer and the database components, such as OBServer nodes, liboblog, and ob_admin, all support SSL/TLS encrypted communication. The communication depends on OpenSSL or a third-party SSL library to enable secure and encrypted data transmission.

## Supported methods for loading private keys or certificates

The communication between OBServer nodes, liboblog, and ob_admin depends on the libeasy library. Therefore, they all support loading private keys and certificates from local files. CA certificates, user certificates, and private keys are stored in the `wallet/` directory and are loaded based on the configuration. This mode is not secure.

## Enable transmission encryption

You can perform the following steps to enable transmission encryption for an OBServer node:

1. Specify the method for loading the private key, user certificate, or CA certificate.

   Load private keys and certificates from local files.

   ```sql
   alter system set ssl_external_kms_info = '
   {
   "ssl_mode":"file"
   }';
   ```

2. Configure the corresponding SSL-enabled protocol.

   ```sql
   alter system set ssl_client_authentication = 'TRUE';
   SSL is enabled for MySQL communication when the parameter is set to TRUE.
   ```

3. Configure an SSL allowlist for RPC communication. TCP connections between OBServer nodes are persistent connections. To enable SSL-encrypted RPC communication, restart the OBServer nodes.

   ```sql
   An allowlist is required to enable SSL-encrypted RPC communication.
   alter system set _ob_ssl_invited_nodes='ALL'; Enable SSL for the entire cluster.
   alter system set _ob_ssl_invited_nodes='xx.xx.xx.xx, xx.xx.xx.xx'; Enable SSL only for OBServer nodes with the specified IP addresses.
   ssl
   ```

## Check whether transmission encryption is enabled for an OBServer node

The most straightforward approach is to capture packets from the MySQL and RPC ports of the OBServer node to check whether the packets are encrypted. You can also use the following method:

* Use the sys tenant account to log on to the OBServer node from OBClient or a MySQL client and query the `ssl_key_expired_time` field of the `oceanbase.GV$OB_SERVERS` table to check whether SSL is enabled.

* This field records the expiration time of the SSL certificate used by the current OBServer node when SSL is enabled. The time is displayed in UTC in microseconds.

  ```sql
  obclient> select svr_ip, svr_port,zone, ssl_key_expired_time, from_unixtime(ssl_key_expired_time/1000000) from oceanbase.GV$OB_SERVERS;
  +--------------+----------+-------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
  | svr_ip       | svr_port | zone  | ssl_key_expired_time | from_unixtime(ssl_key_expired_time/1000000) |
  +--------------+----------+-------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
  | xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx |    13212 | zone1 |           1871860075 | 2029-04-26 09:07:55                         |
  +--------------+----------+-------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

### Check whether SSL is enabled on the MySQL port

Log on to an OBServer node from OBClient or a MySQL client and run the `\s` command to view the information about SSL, as shown in the following example:

```sql
obclient> \s
--------------
obclient  Ver 1.1.8 Distrib 5.7.24, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper

```

### Check whether SSL is enabled on the RPC port

Open the `OBServer.log` file, search for "rpc connection accept", and then check the value of `use_ssl`. If the value is `True`, SSL is enabled for RPC communication. Otherwise, SSL is disabled.
