# Threads

Each OBServer node runs a single observer process. An observer process uses many threads, which can be divided into worker threads and background threads.

## Tenant worker threads

A thread that processes SQL and transaction requests is referred to as a worker thread. Each tenant has its own worker threads.

## Background threads

### Tenant-specific background threads

An observer process contains the following tenant-specific background threads. Each tenant has a set of these threads:

* disk io: the thread that processes disk I/O.

* dag thread: the thread that performs tasks such as the minor compaction, major compaction, and migration of partitions.

* clog writer: the thread that writes clogs.

* election worker: the thread that is used for leader election.

* misc timer: a set of background timer threads that are used to clear resources.

### Non-tenant-specific background threads

An observer process contains the following non-tenant-specific background threads:

* net io: the thread that processes the network I/O.

* RootServer-dedicated threads.
