# Background threads

The following table describes some background threads of OBServer nodes and their features. In most cases, you do not need to pay attention to how these threads are implemented.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Background threads are optimized along with the iteration of OBServer node versions. During the iteration process, some background threads may be eliminated or merged, and some new ones may be introduced. </p>
