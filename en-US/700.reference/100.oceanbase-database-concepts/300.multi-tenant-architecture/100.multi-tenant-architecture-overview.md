# Overview

OceanBase Database uses a cloud database architecture and supports multi-tenant in a cluster. You can deploy OceanBase Database in various types of clouds, such as a public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud.

OceanBase Database implements resource isolation by using tenants. This way, each database instance is isolated and remains invisible to other instances. OceanBase Database uses permission control to ensure data security for all tenants and features extreme scalability. OceanBase Database provides a secure and flexible database-as-a-service (DBaaS) service.

A tenant is a logical concept. In OceanBase Database, a tenant is a resource allocation unit and the basis for the management of database objects and resources. It is critical for system O&M, especially for the O&M of cloud databases. In a sense, tenants are comparable to "instances" in a conventional database system. Tenants are completely isolated from each other. In terms of data security, OceanBase Database forbids cross-tenant access to prevent data assets of a tenant from being stolen by other tenants. In terms of resource utilization, a tenant in OceanBase Database has exclusive resource quotas. In summary, a tenant can be seen as a container for database objects and resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O resources.
