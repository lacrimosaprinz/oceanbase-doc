# Compatibility modes

OceanBase Database supports both MySQL- and Oracle-compatible tenants in a system. You may select the MySQL or Oracle compatibility mode when you create a tenant. After you create a tenant, you cannot change its compatibility mode. All its data types, SQL functions, and views are in line with the MySQL or Oracle mode that you selected.
