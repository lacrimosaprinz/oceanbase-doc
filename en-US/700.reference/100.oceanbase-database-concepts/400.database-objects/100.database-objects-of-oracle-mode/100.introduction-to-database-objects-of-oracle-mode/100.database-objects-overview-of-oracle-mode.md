# Overview

Database objects are components of a database and can be operated and used through SQL statements. This topic provides an overview of the supported types of database objects and their storage methods in the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database. Additionally, it explores the relationships and dependencies between these objects.

The database objects supported in the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database include tables, views, indexes, partitions, sequences, synonyms, triggers, and various procedural language (PL) objects like PL subprograms and packages.

Authorized users in the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database can access the database and have ownership of specific database objects.

OceanBase Database uses schemas to manage sets of database objects owned by users, facilitating privilege management and namespace isolation. Typically, each schema corresponds to an application. Upon user creation, a default schema is assigned, with the schema name being identical to the username.

Users can also access and utilize schemas belonging to other users. When accessing an object without specifying a schema, the system automatically adds the default schema name to the object.

Schema objects are database objects within a specific schema, such as tables, views, and indexes. On the other hand, non-schema objects encompass database objects that are not associated with any particular schema, such as users, roles, tablespaces, and directories.
