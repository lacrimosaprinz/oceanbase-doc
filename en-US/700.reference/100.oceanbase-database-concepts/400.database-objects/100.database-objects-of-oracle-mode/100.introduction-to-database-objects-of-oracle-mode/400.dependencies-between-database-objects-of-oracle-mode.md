# Dependencies between database objects

The relationships and references between database objects are known as dependencies. This topic describes how to create and view dependencies between database objects in OceanBase Database's Oracle mode.

## Create and view dependencies between database objects

Some types of schema objects can reference other objects in their definitions. For example, a view can be defined as a query that references a table or another view. An SQL statement in the procedure body of a stored procedure can reference other database objects. If object B is referenced in the definition of object A, A is a dependent object of B, and B is a referenced object of A.

Dependencies between database objects are useful in some scenarios. For example, when you migrate data between databases, you must recreate schema objects in the destination database. If the schema objects to be recreated are included in a view, you must first recreate the objects on which the view depends. Otherwise, an error message is returned when you recreate the view, indicating that the dependent objects do not exist. You can easily rebuild database objects if dependencies between database objects are known.

You can view dependencies between database objects in the `USER_DEPENDENCIES`, `ALL_DEPENDENCIES`, and `DBA_DEPENDENCIES` views.

**Example 1:** Create a view named `view2` that references the `tbl1` table and the `view1` view.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl1(col1 INT, col2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl2 (col1 INT, col2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE VIEW view1 AS SELECT * FROM tbl2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE VIEW view2 AS SELECT t.col1 AS col1, t.col2 AS col2 FROM tbl1 t, view1 v WHERE
      t.col1 = v.col2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```



**Example 2**: Query the `USER_DEPENDENCIES` view for dependencies between database objects.

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM USER_DEPENDENCIES;
+------+------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------------+------------------+-----------------+
| NAME | TYPE | REFERENCED_OWNER | REFERENCED_NAME | REFERENCED_TYPE | REFERENCED_LINK_NAME | SCHEMAID         | DEPENDENCY_TYPE |
+------+------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------------+------------------+-----------------+
| VIEW1   | VIEW | SYS              | TBL2              | TABLE           | NULL                 | 1100611139403782 | HARD            |
| VIEW2   | VIEW | SYS              | TBL1              | TABLE           | NULL                 | 1100611139403782 | HARD            |
| VIEW2   | VIEW | SYS              | VIEW1              | VIEW            | NULL                 | 1100611139403782 | HARD            |
+------+------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------------+------------------+-----------------+
3 rows in set
```



In the preceding example, the dependencies between database objects are returned in the query result of the view. For example, the `view1` view references the `tbl2` table, and the `view2` view references the `tbl1` table and the `view1` view.

## Considerations

Dependencies between database objects are not maintained in the database in real time and therefore not absolutely accurate. When a referenced object is deleted or rebuilt, the corresponding dependency is updated only in a related Data Manipulation Language (DML) operation or in the next query for the object that depends on the referenced object.

In the following example, `view1` that references `tbl1` is created. After `tbl1` is deleted, their dependency can still be found in the `USER_DEPENDENCIES` view. Then, a DML operation is performed on `view1`, and their dependency is deleted from the `USER_DEPENDENCIES` view.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (col1 INT, col2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE VIEW view1 AS SELECT * FROM tbl1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM USER_DEPENDENCIES;
+------+------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------------+------------------+-----------------+
| NAME | TYPE | REFERENCED_OWNER | REFERENCED_NAME | REFERENCED_TYPE | REFERENCED_LINK_NAME | SCHEMAID         | DEPENDENCY_TYPE |
+------+------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------------+------------------+-----------------+
| VIEW1   | VIEW | SYS              | TBL1              | TABLE           | NULL                 | 1100611139403782 | HARD            |
+------+------+------------------+-----------------+-----------------+----------------------+------------------+-----------------+
1 row in set

obclient> DROP TABLE tbl1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient>SELECT * FROM USER_DEPENDENCIES;

+------+------+------------------+------------------------------+-----------------+----------------------+------------------+-----------------+

obclient> SELECT * FROM view1;

obclient>SELECT * FROM USER_DEPENDENCIES;
