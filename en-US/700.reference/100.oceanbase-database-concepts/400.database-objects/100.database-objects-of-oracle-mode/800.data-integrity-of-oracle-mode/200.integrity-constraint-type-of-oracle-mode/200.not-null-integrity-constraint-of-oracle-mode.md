# NOT NULL constraints

In OceanBase Database, a `NOT NULL` constraint is used to ensure that a specified column of a table is never assigned a `NULL` value.

For versions earlier than OceanBase Database V3.1.X, a `NOT NULL` constraint is considered a property of a column and can be defined only by using the following syntax. After the table is created, you cannot define a `NOT NULL` constraint on a `NULLABLE` column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee(
id NUMBER NOT NULL,
name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
mgr_id NUMBER);
```

Starting from V3.1.X, the OceanBase Database fully supports the `NOT NULL` constraint, with the following features:

When creating a table, you can specify the constraint name and its status. If no name is specified for the `NOT NULL` constraint, the database will generate a constraint name using the current system time. The status can be `RELY`/`NORELY`, `ENABLE`/`DISABLE`, and `VALIDATE`/`NOVALIDATE`. If no status is specified for the `NOT NULL` constraint when creating a table, the default status is `NORELY ENABLE VALIDATE`.

   * `RELY`: The database considers that the column does not contain `NULL` values, allowing for query optimization and other performance enhancements.

   * `ENABLE`: `NULL` values cannot be inserted into the column.

   * `VALIDATE`: The existing data in the column does not contain `NULL` values.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employee(
   id NUMBER CONSTRAINT ID_NOT_NULL NOT NULL NORELY ENABLE VALIDATE,
   name VARCHAR(100) CONSTRAINT NAME_NOT_NULL NOT NULL,
   mgr_id NUMBER);
   ```

* You can view definitions of your `NOT NULL` constraints in the `ALL_CONSTRAINTS` view. The type of `NOT NULL` constraints is `C`. You can also query information about a `NOT NULL` constraint by using the `DBMS_METADATA.GET_DDL` function.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM ALL_CONSTRAINTS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'employee';
   SELECT DBMS_METADATA.GET_DDL('CONSTRAINT', 'ID_NOT_NULL') FROM DUAL;
   ```

* You can use the `ALTER TABLE` statement to add or drop a `NOT NULL` constraint. You can also modify the states of a `NOT NULL` constraint as needed. To insert `NULL` values into the `ID` column, execute one of the following statements to change the states of the `ID_NOT_NULL` constraint to `DISABLE` or drop the constraint.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employee MODIFY CONSTRAINT ID_NOT_NULL DISABLE;
   ALTER TABLE employee DROP CONSTRAINT ID_NOT_NULL;
   ```

   To prevent inserting `NULL` values into the `mgr_id` column, execute the following statement to define a `NOT NULL` constraint on the `mgr_id` column:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employee MODIFY mgr_id NOT NULL;
   ```

   After you execute the preceding statement to define the `NOT NULL` constraint on the `mgr_id` column, OceanBase Database checks whether the existing data contains `NULL` values. If the existing data contains `NULL` values, an error message is returned.
