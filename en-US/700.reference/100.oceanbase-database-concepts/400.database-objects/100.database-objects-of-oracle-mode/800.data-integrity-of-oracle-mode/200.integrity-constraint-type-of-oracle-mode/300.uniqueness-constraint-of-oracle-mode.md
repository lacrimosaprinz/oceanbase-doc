# UNIQUE KEY constraints

The `UNIQUE KEY` constraint is a rule regarding unique column values. It is defined on a specific column or a column set and ensures that the values of the columns or column sets in the rows to be inserted or updated are unique. This constraint ensures that no two rows in a table have the same values for a specific column or column set.

This topic introduces the features of the `UNIQUE KEY` constraint through the following specific examples.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT, c2 INT, CONSTRAINT t1_uk_c1_c2 UNIQUE(c1, c2));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
ORA-00001: unique constraint '1-1' for key 'T1_UK_C1_C2' violated

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(null, 1);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(null, 1);
ORA-00001: unique constraint 'NULL-1' for key 'T1_UK_C1_C2' violated

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(null, null);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(null, null);
Query OK, 1 row affected
```

In the following figure, a `UNIQUE KEY` constraint is defined on the `DNAME` column of the `DEPT` table. In this case, duplicate department names are not allowed in this table, but you can insert null values into the `DNAME` column. If a `NOT NULL` constraint is also defined on the `DNAME` column, you cannot insert null values into the `DNAME` column.

If a `UNIQUE KEY` consists of multiple columns, this set of columns is referred to as a composite unique key. In the example shown below, the `UNIQUE KEY` constraint defined on the `CUSTOMER` table uses a composite unique key, consisting of the `AREA` and `PHONE` columns. This requires that the values of the key in any two rows cannot be duplicate. You can input null values in these columns. However, if the columns are also defined with a `NOT NULL` constraint, null values are not allowed.

You can insert any number of records into the `CUSTOMER` table. However, according to the constraints imposed by `UNIQUE KEY`, the combination of area code and telephone number in each row must be unique. This helps to prevent issues with duplicate phone numbers caused by oversight.
