# PRIMARY KEY constraints

The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint enforces a primary key value rule on a key, which can be a single column or a set of columns. This rule guarantees that the values within the specified column or columns uniquely identify each row in the table.

Only one `PRIMARY KEY` constraint can be defined on each database table. The values of the columns (one or multiple columns) that make up this constraint can serve as a unique identifier for a row of data, naming each data row with this primary key value.

This topic introduces the features of the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint through the following specific examples.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT, c2 INT, CONSTRAINT pk_c1_c2 PRIMARY KEY(c1, c2));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
ORA-00001: unique constraint '1-1' for key 'PK_C1_C2' violated

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(null, 1);
ORA-01400: cannot insert NULL into '(C1)'

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(null, null);
ORA-01400: cannot insert NULL into '(C1)'
```

The `PRIMARY KEY` integrity constraint ensures that the data in a table adheres to the following two rules:

* No duplicate values are allowed in the columns defined as the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint, whether it is a single column or a set of columns.

* The values in the primary key columns cannot be empty or `NULL`. Users are required to input a value for the primary key columns.

Although primary keys are not required, we recommend that you define a primary key for every table. This ensures that each row can be uniquely identified and that no duplicate rows exist in a table.

The diagram below illustrates the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint defined on the `DEPT` table and the rows that violate this constraint. The `DEPT` table contains three columns: `DEPTNO`, `DNAME`, and `LOC`. The primary key constraint is defined on the `DEPTNO` column, which means this column cannot have duplicate values and cannot be empty.

The diagram also shows two rows of data that cannot be inserted into the `DEPT` table due to a violation of the primary key constraint. One row has a primary key value that already exists in the table, and the other row has an empty value in the primary key column.
