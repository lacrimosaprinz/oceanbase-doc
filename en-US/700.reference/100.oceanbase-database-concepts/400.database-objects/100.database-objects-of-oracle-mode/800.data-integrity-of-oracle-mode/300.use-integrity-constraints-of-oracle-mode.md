# Use of integrity constraints

This topic describes the timing of integrity constraint checking and the constraint states.

## Timing of integrity constraint checking

Knowing when OceanBase Database checks constraints helps identify the types of operations that can be performed when various constraints exist. The following examples illustrate when OceanBase Database checks constraints.

In the following figure, the `EMP` table is created. A self-referential constraint is defined on the `EMP` table so that the values of the `MGR` column depend on the values of the `EMPNO` column. For simplicity, the following content addresses only the `EMPNO` (`employee_id`) and `MGR` (`manager_id`) columns of the `EMP` table.

This example concerns the insertion of the first row into the `EMP` table. The value in the `MGR` column cannot reference any existing value in the `EMPNO` column because no data exists in the table. In this case, you can insert a row as described in the following scenarios:

* If no `NOT NULL` constraint is defined on the `MGR` column, you can insert a null value into the `MGR` column in the first row. This row can be inserted into the table because `FOREIGN KEY` constraints allow null values.

* You can insert the same values into the `EMPNO` and `MGR` columns in the first row. In this case, OceanBase Database checks constraints after the statement is executed. To insert the first row with the same value in the parent key and the foreign key, OceanBase Database must first execute the `INSERT` statement to insert the first row and then check whether any row in the table has an `EMPNO` column value that corresponds to the `MGR` column value of the first row.

* Execute a multiple row `INSERT` statement, such as an `INSERT` statement with nested `SELECT` statements to insert multiple rows that reference one another. For example, the first row may have 200 for the `EMPNO` column and 300 for the `MGR` column, whereas the second row may have 300 for the `EMPNO` column and 200 for the `MGR` column.

In this case, constraint checking is deferred until the complete execution of the `INSERT` statement. OceanBase Database first inserts all rows and then checks for constraint violations row by row.

The following example illustrates when OceanBase Database checks a self-referential constraint for an `UPDATE` statement. Assume that the company is acquired and all employee numbers must be increased by 5000 to be consistent with the employee numbers of the new company. Manager numbers must also be increased by 5000 because they are also employee numbers. The following figure shows the `EMP` table before the update. This table contains the `EMPNO` and `MGR` columns. The `EMPNO` column has three values: 210, 211, and 212. The `MGR` column has two values: 210 and 211.

![Integrity constraint 3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.1/700.reference/100.oceanbase-database-concepts/800.data-integrity-of-oracle-mode/300.use-integrity-constraints-of-oracle-mode/2.integrity-constraints2.png)

Execute the following SQL statement on the `EMP` table:

```sql
UPDATE EMP
SET empno = empno + 5000,
mgr = mgr + 5000;
```

Although the constraint defined on the `EMP` table requires that each `MGR` column value must correspond to an `EMPNO` column value, the preceding statement can still be executed because OceanBase Database checks the constraint after the statement is executed. The following figure shows that OceanBase Database checks the constraint after all operations of the SQL statement are performed.

![Integrity constraint 5](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/EN_US/7.reference/300.database-object-management/UNIQUE-KEY-4.png)

First, `5000` is added to each employee number and then each manager number. In Step 1, `210` in the `EMPNO` column is updated to `5210`. In Step 2, `211` in the `EMPNO` column is updated to `5211`, and `210` in the `MGR` column is updated to `5210`. In Step 3, `212` in the `EMPNO` column is updated to `5212`, and `211` in the `MGR` column is updated to `5211`. Finally, OceanBase Database checks the constraint.

The examples in this section describe the constraint checking mechanism for `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements. In fact, the constraint checking mechanism is the same for all types of DML statements, including `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` statements.

## Constraint states

In the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database, `FOREIGN KEY` constraints, `CHECK` constraints, and `NOT NULL` constraints all support two types of states: `ENABLE` or `DISABLE` and `VALIDATE` or `NOVALIDATE`. `ENABLE` or `DISABLE` specifies whether to check whether new data inserted or updated by executing DML statements on the table conforms to the constraint. `VALIDATE` or `NOVALIDATE` indicates whether all existing data in the table conforms to the constraint.

**Default constraint states**

When you create a constraint, its default state for `ENABLE` or `DISABLE` is `ENABLE`.

If the state for `ENABLE` or `DISABLE` is `ENABLE`, the default state for `VALIDATE` or `NOVALIDATE` is `VALIDATE`.

If the state for `ENABLE` or `DISABLE` is `DISABLE`, the default state for `VALIDATE` or `NOVALIDATE` is `NOVALIDATE`.


**Constraint state combinations**

* `ENABLE VALIDATE`: OceanBase Database checks the validity of new data and existing data in the table. If the existing data violates the constraint, you cannot modify the constraint states to `ENABLE VALIDATE` or create a constraint whose states are `ENABLE VALIDATE`.

* `ENABLE NOVALIDATE`: OceanBase Database does not check the validity of existing data. It checks only the validity of new data in the table.

* `DISABLE VALIDATE`: DML operations cannot be performed on the table.

* `DISABLE NOVALIDATE`: The constraint is invalid. OceanBase Database does not check the validity of the existing data or new data in the table.

**Sample SQL syntax for constraint states**

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(0, 1);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 ADD CONSTRAINT cst CHECK(c1 = c2) ENABLE VALIDATE;
ORA-02293: cannot validate (TEST.CST) - check constraint violated

obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 ADD CONSTRAINT cst CHECK(c1 = c2) DISABLE VALIDATE;
ORA-02293: cannot validate (TEST.CST) - check constraint violated

obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 ADD CONSTRAINT cst CHECK(c1 = c2) ENABLE NOVALIDATE;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(0, 1);
ORA-02290: check constraint violated

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY CONSTRAINT cst DISABLE NOVALIDATE;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(0, 1);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> DELETE FROM t1 WHERE c1 != c2;
Query OK, 2 rows affected

obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY CONSTRAINT cst DISABLE VALIDATE;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
ORA-25128: No insert/update/delete on table with constraint (TEST.CST) disabled and validated

obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY CONSTRAINT cst ENABLE VALIDATE;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(0, 1);
ORA-02290: check constraint violated

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
Query OK, 1 row affected
```
