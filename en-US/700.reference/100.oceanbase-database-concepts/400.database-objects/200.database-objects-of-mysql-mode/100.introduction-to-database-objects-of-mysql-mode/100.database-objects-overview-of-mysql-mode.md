# Overview

Database objects are components of a database and can be operated and used through SQL statements. This topic provides an overview of the supported types of database objects and their storage methods in the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database. Additionally, it explores the relationships and dependencies between these objects.

The database objects supported in the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database include tables, views, indexes, partitions, sequences, triggers, and stored procedures.

Authorized users in the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database can access the database and access or manage database objects. A database is a collection of database objects that is used for privilege management and namespace isolation. A schema is a synonym for a database. In SQL statements, the keyword `SCHEMA` can be used instead of `DATABASE`. For example, `CREATE SCHEMA` can be used instead of `CREATE DATABASE`.
