# Database object types

This topic describes the object types supported by the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database.

For more information, see the following table.


| Object type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Table | The most basic storage unit in a database. A table is organized into rows and columns.  |
| View | A view is a virtual table whose content is defined by a query. Like a real table, a view consists of columns with names and rows of data. However, a view does not exist as a stored collection of data values in the database. The row and column data come from the tables referenced by the query that defines the view, and it is dynamically generated when the view is referenced.|
| Index | An index is a structure to sort data in one or more columns of a database table in a specific order. It enables you to quickly access specific information in the database table. For example, an index enables you to quickly search for a specified employee by last name, which is more efficient than searching all rows in a table.  |
| Partition | OceanBase Database can split the data of a table into different groups based on some rules. Data in the same group is stored in the same physical area. A table whose data is split into different groups is called a partitioned table.  Tables in OceanBase Database are horizontally partitioned. Each partition contains some data rows. A table can be partitioned by specified partitioning methods such as hash partitioning, range partitioning, and list partitioning based on the mapping relationships between data and partitions.  Each partition can be divided into several subpartitions from different dimensions. For example, you can partition the transaction table into several hash partitions based on the user IDs. Then, you can partition each hash partition into several range partitions based on the transaction time.  |
| Trigger | A trigger is a set of stored procedures that is automatically invoked by the system when a specified event occurs. Unlike regular stored procedures, triggers can be enabled or disabled and cannot be explicitly invoked. |
| Stored program | A stored program is a set of SQL statements that are designed to perform specific tasks and stored in the database after compilation. You can call a stored program by specifying its name and parameters as needed.  A stored program is a programmable function that consists of SQL statements and a control structure. A stored program can be created and saved in a database.  |
