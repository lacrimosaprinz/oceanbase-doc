# Database object storage

OceanBase Database stores the data of some database objects in one or more SSTables. An SSTable contains one or more macroblocks. Each macroblock contains one or more microblocks. Each microblock contains one or more rows. Some database objects, such as views and virtual tables, do not store actual data because they contain only metadata.
