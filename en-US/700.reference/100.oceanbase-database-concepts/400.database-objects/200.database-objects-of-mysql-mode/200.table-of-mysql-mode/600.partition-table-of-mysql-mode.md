# Partitioned table

OceanBase Database supports non-partitioned tables and partitioned tables.

A table without a defined partitioning mode is called a non-partitioned table. Otherwise, it is partitioned table.

A partitioned table consists of one or more partitions that are separately managed and can operate independently of each other. A partitioned table is different from a non-partitioned table even if the partitioned table consists of only one partition. You cannot add partitions to a non-partitioned table.

For more information about partitions, see [Partition overview](../400.partition-of-mysql-mode/100.partitions-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).
