# Unique and non-unique indexes

Indexes are classified into unique and non-unique indexes. Unique indexes ensure that no two rows of a table have duplicate values in an indexed column. Non-unique indexes allow duplicate values in an indexed column. In OceanBase Database, `NULL` values are also stored in indexes.

Storage keys of a non-unique index table are the user-specified indexed column and the primary key column in the primary table. Storage keys of a unique index table are the user-specified indexed column and a variable primary key column in the primary table. "Variable" means that values of the primary key column vary with the values of the indexed column.

In the following example, storage keys of the `i1` table with a non-unique index are `c2` and `c1`. The storage key of the `i2` table with a unique index is `c3`, and `c1` is variable. When `c3` is `NULL`, the value of the variable `c1` column is the same as that of the `c1` column in the primary table. When `c3` is not `NULL`, the value of the variable `c1` column is `NULL`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT, c4 INT, PRIMARY KEY(c1));
CREATE INDEX i1 ON t1(c2);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX i2 ON t1(c3);
```
