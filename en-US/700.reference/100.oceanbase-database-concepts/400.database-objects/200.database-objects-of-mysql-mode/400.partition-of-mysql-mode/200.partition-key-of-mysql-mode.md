# Partitioning keys

A partitioning key consists of one or more columns that determine how rows are stored in partitions of a table. Each row is assigned to a specified partition.

For example, you can use the range partitioning method and define the `user_id` column as the partitioning key in a user table. The database assigns rows to partitions based on the range of values in the partitioning key column.

OceanBase Database automatically directs insert, update, and delete operations to the corresponding partition by using the partitioning key.
