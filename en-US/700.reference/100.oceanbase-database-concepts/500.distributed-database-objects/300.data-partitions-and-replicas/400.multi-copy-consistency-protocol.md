# Multi-replica consensus protocols

This topic describes two consensus protocols that are supported by OceanBase Database.

In OceanBase Database, data is stored and used on multiple nodes. Data includes data persisted to disks and data in the memory. Consistency between data replicas is maintained based on a consensus protocol.

OceanBase Database implements a distributed consensus protocol based on Multi-Paxos to ensure lossless data recovery based on data in the followers when the leader fails. This protocol lays a foundation for the high availability of OceanBase Database. For more information, see [Paxos protocol](../../1000.high-data-reliability-and-availability/100.high-availability-architecture/500.paxos-protocol.md).

OceanBase Database implements both protocols by replicating the redo logs of transactions. For more information about redo logs, see [Multi-replica log synchronization](../../1000.high-data-reliability-and-availability/100.high-availability-architecture/400.multi-replica-log-synchronization.md).
