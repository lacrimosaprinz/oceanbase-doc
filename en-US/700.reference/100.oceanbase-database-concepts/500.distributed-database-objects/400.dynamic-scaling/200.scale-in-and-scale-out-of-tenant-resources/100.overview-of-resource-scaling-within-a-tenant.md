# Overview

In OceanBase Database, tenant resources can be managed horizontally, vertically, or across zones.

## Horizontal management of tenant resources

The horizontal resource management of a tenant refers to that, by adjusting the value of `UNIT_NUM` of the tenant resource pool, the number of nodes providing services for the tenant in the cluster is increased or decreased, thereby changing the overall service capability of the tenant, and the `UNIT_NUM` value of the resource pool can be dynamically increased or decreased as needed. For more information, see [Horizontal scaling of tenant resources](../200.scale-in-and-scale-out-of-tenant-resources/200.horizontal-scaling-of-tenant-resources.md).

## Vertical management of tenant resources

Vertical management of tenant resources refers to resizing each resource unit used by a tenant to change the service capability of the tenant on each OBServer node, so as to change the overall service capability of the tenant. You can resize a resource unit used by a tenant in either of the following ways:

* Apply new resource specifications (unit_config) to the resource unit.

* Resize the current resource specifications (unit_config) of the resource unit.

For more information, see [Vertical scaling of tenant resources](../200.scale-in-and-scale-out-of-tenant-resources/300.vertical-scaling-of-tenant-resources.md).

## Cross-zone management of tenant resources

Cross-zone management of tenant resources refers to modifying the `ZONE_LIST` parameter of a resource unit used by a tenant to change the distribution of tenant resources, so as to adjust the number of replicas for each data record of the tenant and adjust the disaster recovery capability of the tenant. For more information, see [Cross-zone management of tenant resources](../200.scale-in-and-scale-out-of-tenant-resources/400.tenant-cross-zone-resource-management.md).
