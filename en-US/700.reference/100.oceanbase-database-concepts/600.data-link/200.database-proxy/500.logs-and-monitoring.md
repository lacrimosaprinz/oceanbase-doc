# Logs and monitoring

When OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) is running, ODP sends request information and error information to corresponding log files. You can perform targeted analysis based on the log files. In addition, OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides rich monitoring information about ODP.

## `obproxy_digest.log` file

If the value of the `query_digest_time_threshold` parameter for a request exceeds the threshold or an error response is returned for the request, the request information is sent to the `obproxy_digest.log` file. The default value of `query_digest_time_threshold` is 100 and that for the primary site is 2, in milliseconds.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p><code>query_digest_time_threshold</code> specifies the threshold of request execution duration. If the execution duration exceeds the threshold, a log is recorded in the <code>query_digest_time_threshold</code> file. For more information about this parameter, see <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-odp-en-10000000000864246">Dynamically modifiable parameters</a> of ODP. </p>

## ODP monitoring

In addition to various ODP logs, you can view ODP monitoring information by using OCP. OCP is a database management and O&M service provided by OceanBase Database.

The cluster performance monitoring feature of ODP supports service monitoring and system monitoring.

### Service monitoring

The service monitoring feature collects the following statistics for ODP clusters, OceanBase clusters that are associated with ODP, and ODP IP addresses: **number of transactions per second, number of requests, number of client connections, number of server connections, SQL execution duration, number of error response packets per second, route table**, and **number of bytes for network requests**.

### System monitoring

The system monitoring feature collects the following statistics for ODP clusters and ODP IP addresses: **Linux system load**, **CPU utilization, average number of I/O requests per second, average execution duration of I/O requests per second, average data amount of I/O requests per second, network throughput, memory usage**, and **disk usage**.

For more information about ODP monitoring, see the **ODP cluster performance monitoring** section in OCP User Guide.
