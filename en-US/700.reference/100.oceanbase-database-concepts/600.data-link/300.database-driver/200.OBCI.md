# OBCI

OceanBase Call Interface (OBCI) is an API developed based on C for OceanBase Database. OBCI provides features that are fully compatible with Oracle Call Interface (OCI).

## Overview

OCI is a client-side API provided by Oracle. You can call OCI to access Oracle database servers and manage database operations by using SQL statements. OCI supports all SQL data definition, data manipulation, query, and transaction management operations. It also supports the data types, call methods, syntax, and semantics of C and C++. OCI provides a set of interface subroutines, also known as functions, that have access to Oracle databases.  OBCI is an Oracle-compatible interface that is developed based on interface standards of OCI considering features of OceanBase Database. OBCI supports the interface capabilities and user behavior processing of OCI. OBCI allows developers to quickly access OceanBase clusters in Oracle mode from clients such as Oracle Template Library (OTL), Tuxedo, and OceanBase Embedded SQL in C (ECOB).

The basic concepts of OBCI and OCI are described as follows:

* OBCI: an API that can be used by clients to access OceanBase Database.

* OCI: an API that can be used by clients to access Oracle databases.

* libobclient/libobclnt: an API that can be used by clients to manage databases. This API serves as an OBCI dependency.

* Oracle mode: a processing mode of OceanBase Database that is compatible with Oracle syntax.

## Features

OBCI allows you to access and manage data in the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database by using the C language. OBCI provides standard database access and index features in the form of dynamic link libraries (OCI libraries). Applications can connect to these libraries and use the features provided in the libraries.

OBCI provides the following main features:

* Serves as a standard API that can be used to access and process data in the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database. OBCI provides features such as data definition, data management, data query and processing, and transaction control.

* Supports the development of scalable and multi-threaded applications.

* Supports SQL access functions that you can use to manage database access, process SQL statements, and manipulate objects retrieved from OBServer nodes.

* Supports data type mapping and manipulation functions that allow you to manipulate OceanBase data type attributes.

* Supports data loading functions that allow you to directly load data into a database without using SQL statements.

* Supports external procedure functions. You can specify callback functions by using C in a PL/SQL body.

## Benefits

Compared with access to OceanBase Database by directly using a database protocol or calling a C interface, OBCI has the following benefits:

* Encapsulates database access operations and simplifies the business implementation logic.

* Supports third-party framework capabilities, such as Tuxedo and OTL.

* Allows you to use connection pools and statement cache to improve program scalability.

* Supports dynamic parameter binding and the processing of result callback functions. This allows programs to process parameters and outputs in an efficient manner.

* Provides interfaces to query metadata.

* Provides capabilities to access and manage complex data such as arrays by using DML statements such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

* Supports the prefetch feature, which reduces the interactions with the backend.

* Ensures thread security and reduces the use of mutex by services.

## Supported SQL statements

* DDL statements

* Control statements:

   * Transaction control

   * Session control

   * System control

* DML statements

* Query statements

* PL/SQL statements and the NOLOCK hint

## Data types

OBCI supports internal data types in the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database and external data types that are compatible with OCI and defined in `<oci.h>` by using C.

### Internal data types

Internal data types are data types that can be used in the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database.

The following table describes the general internal data types that are supported by OBCI.

| Data type | Description | Limit |
|---------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| char | A character string that has a fixed length. | Maximum length: 2000. |
| varchar2 | A character string that has a variable length. | Maximum length: 32767. |
| number | A numeric value. | Range of precision: 1 to 38. Range of scale: -84 to 127. |
| int | An integer. | Maximum number of digits: 38. |
| binary_float | A 32-bit floating-point number. | Value range: [1.17549E-38F, 3.40282E+38F]. |
| binary_double | A 64-bit floating-point number. | Value range: [2.22507485850720E-308, 1.79769313486231E+308]. |
| date | A date. | Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS. |
| timestamp | A timestamp. | Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS [.FFFFFFFFF]. |

## External data types

External data types specify the types of data in host variables. When you import data to OceanBase Database, OBCI converts the external data types of the input host variables to the corresponding internal data types. When you export data to an external program, OBCI converts the internal data types of the database table to the corresponding external data types of the host variables.

The following table describes the general external data types that are supported by OBCI, and the data type mappings.

| External data types | Code | Data type of host variable | OBCI type |
|------------------------------------------|-----|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| VARCHAR2 | 1 | char[n] | SQLT_CHR |
| NUMBER | 2 | unsigned char[21] | SQLT_NUM |
| 8-bit signed INTEGER | 3 | signed char | SQLT_INT |
| 16-bit signed INTEGER | 3 | signed short, signed int | SQLT_INT |
| 32-bit signed INTEGER | 3 | signed int, signed long | SQLT_INT |
| FLOAT | 4 | float, double | SQLT_FLT |
| LONG | 8 | char[n] | SQLT_LNG |
| NULL-terminated STRING | 5 | char[n+1] | SQLT_STR |
| LONG | 8 | char[n] | SQLT_LNG |
| VARCHAR | 9 | char[n+sizeof(short integer)] SQLT_VCS | VARCHAR |
| DATE | 12 | unsigned char[n] | SQLT_BIN |
| RAW | 23 | char[7] | SQLT_DAT |
| CHAR | 96 | char[n] | SQLT_AFC |
| REF | 110 | OCIRef | SQLT_REF |
| Character LOB descriptor | 112 | OCILobLocator (see note 2) | SQLT_CLOB |
| Binary LOB descriptor | 113 | OCILobLocator (see note 2) | SQLT_BLOB |
| ANSI DATE descriptor | 184 | OCIDateTime * | SQLT_DATE |
| TIMESTAMP descriptor | 187 | OCIDateTime * | SQLT_TIMESTAMP |
| TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONEdescriptor | 188 | OCIDateTime * | SQLT_TIMESTAMP_TZ |
| TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONEdescriptor | 232 | OCIDateTime * | SQLT_TIMESTAMP_LTZ |

## Data type conversion

In OBCI, host variables use external data types. Data type conversion is required for data that is read from OceanBase Database to external variables, or for external data that is stored in OceanBase Database.

The following table lists the supported conversion operations.

|                                   | **VARCHAR2/CHAR** | **INT** | **NUMBER** | **FLOAT** | **BINARY_FLOAT** | **BINARY_DOUBLE** | **DATE** | **TIMESTAMP** |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|---------|------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| **CHAR/UNSIGNED CHAR** | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT |          |               |
| **INT/UNSIGNED INT** | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT |          |               |
| **LONG/UNSIGNED LONG** | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT |          |               |
| **LONG LONG/UNSIGNED LONG LONG** | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT |          |               |
| **FLOAT** | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT |          |               |
| **DOUBLE** | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT |          |               |
| **CHAR[n]/VARCHAR[n]/CHAR*** | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN/OUT | IN |

**Note**

* The table does not include possible errors during the conversion. For example, errors such as overflows and invalid numbers may occur when OBCI converts `VARCHAR2` into `CHAR` in C.

* IN indicates the conversion from a C language variable to an internal data type of OceanBase Database during data writes. OUT indicates the conversion from an internal data type of OceanBase Database to a C language variable during data reads.
