# OceanBase Connector/C

OceanBase Connector/C is an OBClient development component based on C/C++. OceanBase Connector/C supports C API libraries.

OceanBase Connector/C allows C/C++ applications to access distributed OceanBase clusters from the underlying layer. Then, the applications can perform operations such as database connection, data access, error processing, and prepared statement processing.

OceanBase Connector/C is also called LibobClient and is used as an independent server process for applications to communicate with OBServer nodes based on network connections. A client application references the C API header file during compilation and can connect to the C API library file.

## Functions and objects

The following table lists the supported C API functions.
