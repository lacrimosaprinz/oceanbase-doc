# Overview

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific programming language that is used to access data and to query, update, and manage relational databases. Both programs and users can read and write data by executing SQL statements.

SQL provides an interface to a relational database such as OceanBase Database.

SQL unifies tasks such as the following in one consistent language:

* Creating, replacing, updating, and dropping objects

* Inserting, updating, and deleting table rows

* Query data

* Managing access to databases and their objects

* Ensuring database consistency and integrity

You can interactively use SQL statements by sending them to OceanBase Database. You can also embed them into the code of different languages, such as C and Java.
