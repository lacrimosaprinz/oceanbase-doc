# SQL standards

OceanBase Database follows industry-accepted standards.

At present, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) are the industry-accepted committees.  Both ANSI and ISO/IEC have accepted SQL as the standard language for relational databases.

The SQL standard is made up of ten parts. One part (SQL/RPR:2012) was revised in 2012. Five other parts were revised in 2011. The rest four parts have not been updated since 2008.

OceanBase Database SQL provides many extensions to the ANSI/ISO standard SQL language. The OceanBase Database tools OBClient and OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) allow you to run all ANSI/ISO standard and extended SQL statements and functions against an OceanBase database.
