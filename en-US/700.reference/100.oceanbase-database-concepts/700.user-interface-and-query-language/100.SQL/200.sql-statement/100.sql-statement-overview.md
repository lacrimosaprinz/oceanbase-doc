# Overview

In OceanBase Database, all operations, including O&M and data processing operations, are performed by using SQL statements.

An SQL statement is an instruction that consists of identifiers, parameters, variables, names, data types, and SQL reserved words.

An SQL statement must be a complete SQL sentence, such as:

```sql
​SELECT last_name, department_id FROM employee;
```

OceanBase Database executes only complete SQL statements. For example, the following fragment will generate an error indicating that more text is required:

```sql
​SELECT last_name;
```

In OceanBase Database, SQL statements can be divided into the following three types:

* DDL statements

* DML statements

* DCL statements
