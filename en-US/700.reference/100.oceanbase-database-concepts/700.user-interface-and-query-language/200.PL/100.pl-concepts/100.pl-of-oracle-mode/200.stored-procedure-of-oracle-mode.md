# Stored procedures

A stored procedure is a pre-compiled collection of SQL statements and optional control flow statements and is processed as a unit by the procedural language (PL) engine. A stored procedure can reference other stored procedures and return multiple variables.

## Structure of a stored procedure

The following sample code shows the structure of a stored procedure:

```sql
PROCEDURE name [ ( parameter_list ) ]
{ IS | AS }
[ declarative_part ]
BEGIN    -- Start execution
statement; [ statement; ]...
[ EXCEPTION ]
exception_handler; [ exception_handler; ]... ]
END;
```

## Create a stored procedure

You can use the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement to create a stored procedure. Syntax for creating a stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE Procedure_name
[ (argment [ { IN | IN OUT }] Type,
      argment [ { IN | OUT | IN OUT } ] Type ]
    [ AUTHID DEFINER | CURRENT_USER ]
{ IS | AS }
delarification_block
BEGIN
    procedure_body
EXCEPTION
  exception_handler
END;
```

Example for creating a stored procedure that has no parameters:

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE loghistory
      (userid VARCHAR2(20),
      logdate DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE);
Query OK, 0 rows affected
obclient> DELIMITER /
obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE userlogin
      IS
  BEGIN
      INSERT INTO loghistory (userid) VALUES (USER);
  END;
  /
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Call a stored procedure

After a stored procedure is created, an authorized user can call and run the procedure from OBClient, OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), or a third-party development tool.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM loghistory;
Empty set

obclient> BEGIN
     userlogin;
     END;
     /
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM loghistory;
+--------+-----------+
| USERID | LOGDATE   |
+--------+-----------+
| HR     | 27-SEP-20 |
+--------+-----------+
1 row in set

obclient> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
