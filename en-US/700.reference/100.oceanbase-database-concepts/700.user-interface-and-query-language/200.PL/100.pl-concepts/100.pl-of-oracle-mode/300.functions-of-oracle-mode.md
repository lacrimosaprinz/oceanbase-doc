# Functions

Functions are the same as stored procedures, except that a value is returned after the execution of a function.

## Function structure

You must declare the data type of the returned value when creating a function. The function structure is as follows:

```sql
FUNCTION name [ ( parameter_list ) ] RETURN sp_type
{ IS | AS }
[ declarative_part ]
BEGIN -- executable part begins
statement; [ statement; ]...
[ EXCEPTION ]
exception_handler; [ exception_handler; ]... ]
END;
```

## Create a function

You can execute the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement to create a function. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION func RETURN INT
IS
BEGIN
RETURN 1;
END;
/
```

Create a function in a package. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE pack IS
  FUNCTION func RETURN INT;
 END;
 /
 CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY pack IS
   FUNCTION func RETURN INT
   IS
   BEGIN
   RETURN 1;
   END;
 END;
 /
```

Define a function inside a subprogram. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
DECLARE
  FUNCTION func RETURN INT
  IS
  BEGIN
  RETURN 1;
  END;
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
/
```
