# Overview

Isolation levels are defined based on phenomena that must be prevented during the concurrent execution of transactions.

The following phenomena are preventable:

* Dirty read: A transaction reads the data that has not been committed by other transactions.

* Non-repeatable read: When you query a row of data that you have read, you find that this row of data has been modified or deleted. For example, for `select c2 from test where c1=1;`, the value of `c2` queried for the first time is `1`. When you query `c2` again, its value becomes `2` because other transactions have modified the value.

* Phantom read: A read-only request returns a group of rows that meet query conditions. The next time the request is executed, you find that other rows that meet the conditions have been inserted by a committed transaction.

Based on the preceding three phenomena, the ANSI and ISO/IEC standards define the following isolation levels:

* Read uncommitted

* Read committed

* Repeatable read

* Serializable

The following table compares the four isolation levels.

| Isolation level | Dirty read | Non-repeatable read | Phantom read |
|----------|----|-------|----|
| **Read uncommitted** | Possible | Possible | Possible |
| **Read committed** | Impossible | Possible | Possible |
| **Repeatable read** | Impossible | Impossible | Possible |
| **Serializable** | Impossible | Impossible | Impossible |

OceanBase Database supports the following isolation levels:

* Oracle mode

   * Read committed

   * Repeatable read

   * Serializable

* MySQL mode

   * Read committed

   * Repeatable read

   * Serializable

      It is similar to the serializable isolation level in Oracle Database, but is not strictly a serializable isolation level.

By default, OceanBase Database uses the read committed isolation level.
