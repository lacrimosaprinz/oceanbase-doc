# Transaction isolation levels in MySQL mode

## Isolation levels supported in MySQL mode

The MySQL mode of OceanBase Database supports the following isolation levels:

* Read committed: A query executed by a transaction can read only the data committed before the query starts. This isolation level cannot prevent non-repeatable or phantom reads. It is simple, efficient, and suitable for applications with few conflicting transactions.

* Repeatable read: The same data read at different times within a transaction is consistent. This isolation level cannot prevent phantom reads.

* Serializable: It is similar to the serializable isolation level in Oracle Database but is not strictly a serializable isolation level.

By default, OceanBase Database uses the read committed isolation level.

## Isolation level settings

You can set the isolation level to the global level or the session level.

```sql
SET [GLOBAL | SESSION] TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ
```

## Limitations

The repeatable read isolation level supported by the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database can prevent more exceptions than MySQL Database.
