# GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view displays the statistics of each SQL request on all OBServer nodes, such as its source and execution status. This view is tenant-specific and cannot be queried by other tenants, except for the sys tenant.

## General SQL information

### SQL routing information

In OceanBase Database, SQL plans are divided into the following four types:

* Local plans: The transaction session and the Leader of the partitions involved in the SQL statement are on the same OBServer node. The SQL statement may involve multiple partitions, but a table cannot contain multiple partitions.

* Remote plans: The transaction session and the Leader of the partitions involved in the SQL statement are on different OBServer nodes. The SQL statement may involve multiple partitions, but a table cannot contain multiple partitions.

* Distributed plans: The SQL statement involves operations on multiple partitions. The partitions can be in one or more OBServer nodes.

* Uncertain plans: The number of partitions involved cannot be determined when the SQL statement is executed. These SQL execution plans typically exist in scenarios with global indexes and foreign keys.

Local transactions are committed more efficiently than cross-server transactions. Therefore, you need to check whether the percentages of different types of SQL execution plans are as expected. You can execute the following statement to collect statistics on SQL plans by type.

```sql
select plan_type, count(1) from GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT where tenant_id = *** and request_time > time_to_usec('2021-10-08 12:00:00') group by plan_type;
```

The value of `plan_type` can be `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`, indicating a local plan, a remote plan, a distributed plan, or an uncertain plan, respectively.

### Slow SQL statistics

You can query the SQL statements whose execution time exceeds the specified threshold during a period, and thereby optimize the SQL plans based on the query result.

```sql
select tenant_id, elapsed_time, usec_to_time(request_time), substr(query_sql, 1, 50) from GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT where tenant_id=1001 and elapsed_time > 100000 and request_time > time_to_usec('2021-10-08 12:00:00') order by elapsed_time desc limit 40;
```

### SQL statistics within a transaction

Each SQL statement entry in `sql_audit` records the unique identifier of the current SQL transaction in transaction_hash. You can check this field to find all SQL information about the current transaction. Then, you can determine whether the transaction model, including single-SQL transaction and multi-SQL transaction, in business stress testing meets your expectation.

```sql
select tenant_id, substr(query_sql,1,50) from GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT where tenant_id=1002 and  TX_ID='***' order by request_time;
```

### SQL statements executed in the same session

You can query all business requests by SID to analyze the business model.

```sql
select tenant_id, substr(query_sql,1,50) from GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT where tenant_id=1002 and sid=1001 and request_time > time_to_usec('2021-10-08 12:00:00') order by request_time;
```
