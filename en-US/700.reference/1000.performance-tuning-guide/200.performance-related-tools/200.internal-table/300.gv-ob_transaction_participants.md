## Common SQL statements

The `GV$OB_TRANSACTION_PARTICIPANTS` view displays the statistics on all active transactions in a cluster. A transaction involves write operations of N log streams, and each log stream generates a record. You can query this view for time-consuming transactions.

Query the `GV$OB_TRANSACTION_PARTICIPANTS` view for participants of active transactions that take more than 100s. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
obclient> SELECT svr_ip, tx_id, ls_id from GV$OB_TRANSACTION_PARTICIPANTS where tenant_id = xxx and ctx_create_time < date_sub(now(), INTERVAL 100 SECOND);
```

You can query the `GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view based on the `tx_id` field for all SQL statements in the transaction and their time consumption information.
