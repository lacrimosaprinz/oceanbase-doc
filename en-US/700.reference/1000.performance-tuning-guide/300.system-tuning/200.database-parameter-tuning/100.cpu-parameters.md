# CPU parameters

| Parameter | Description | Recommended value/range |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| workers_per_cpu_quota | Specifies the maximum number of worker threads allowed for a tenant on each CPU. workers_per_cpu_quota * Maximum number of CPU cores for the tenant = Maximum number of worker threads available to the tenant. | The maximum number of worker threads available to the tenant are those that are allocatable and usable, rather than the maximum number of threads allowed for concurrent running. In general cases, do not adjust this parameter.  |
| net_thread_count | Specifies the number of network threads for receiving client requests. | This parameter takes effect upon a restart. You can run top -H to check the usage of MySQL I/O threads. If the usage is higher than 90%, the thread for receiving requests may have become a bottleneck. In this case, we recommend that you increase the value of this parameter. If the usage of each thread is less than 50%, we recommend that you reduce the value of this parameter to mitigate the overhead of thread switching. |
| autoinc_cache_refresh_interval | Specifies the working interval of the background thread for automatic leader switching. | We recommend that you set it to a large value. |
| enable_early_lock_release | Specifies whether to enable early lock release (ELR) for rows. | We recommend that you enable this feature in hot-row scenarios. |
| enable_monotonic_weak_read | Specifies whether to enable monotonic reads. | We recommend that you disable this feature in performance scenarios. |
| weak_read_version_refresh_interval | Specifies the interval for refreshing the weak consistency read version. | When the value is 0, the weak consistency read version is not refreshed, and the monotonic read feature is disabled. In performance scenarios, we recommend that you disable this feature. |
| enable_sql_audit | Specifies whether to enable SQL Audit. | This feature is required in a production environment and can be disabled in performance testing scenarios. |
| enable_perf_event | Specifies whether to enable information collection. | This feature is required in a production environment and can be disabled in performance testing scenarios. |
| enable_record_trace_log | Specifies whether to enable trace logs. | In a production environment, you can disable this feature when the Perf Event and SQL Audit features are enabled. |
| _ob_get_gts_ahead_interval | Specifies the time interval at which GTS is obtained in advance. | We recommend that you set the parameter based on your business requirement in the range of 1 ms to 5 ms. If the service response time is long, you can increase the value. |
| _trace_control_info | Specifies whether to enable end-to-end diagnostics. | You can disable this feature in performance tests as needed.  |
