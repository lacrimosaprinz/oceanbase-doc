# Network transmission parameters

| Parameter | Description | Recommended value/range |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| server_tcp_user_timeout | The user timeout period for the TCP connection between OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) and an OBServer node. The default value is `0s`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| client_tcp_user_timeout | The user timeout period for the TCP connection between ODP and a client. The default value is `0s`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| client_max_connections | The maximum number of client connections that ODP supports. The default value is `8192`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| connect_observer_max_retries | The maximum number of retries for ODP to connect to the OBServer node. The default value is `3`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| observer_query_timeout_delta | The network transmission delay added to the `ob_query_timeout` parameter of an OBServer node, in seconds. Value range: [1, 39]. Default value: 20. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| sock_option_flag_out | The binary-bit parameter for the TCP connection between an ODP and an OBServer node.<li>If bit 0 is 1, no_delay is enabled.<li>If bit 1 is 1, keepalive is enabled. <li>If bit 2 is 1, linger_on is enabled.<br>The default value of this parameter varies based on the versions of ODP:<li>In ODP V1.8.X, the default value is `1`, which indicates that bit 0 is 1 and no_delay is enabled.<li> In ODP V3.X, the default value is `3`, which indicates that both bit 0 and bit 1 are 1, and no_delay and keepalive are enabled. | <li>If you use ODP V1.8.X, we recommend that you set the value to `3`.<li> If you use ODP V3.X, we recommend that you use the default value. |
| server_tcp_keepidle | The idle time before a keepalive packet is sent for the TCP connection between an ODP and an OBServer node, in seconds. Default value: 5. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| server_tcp_keepintvl | The interval between two keepalive packets for the TCP connection between an ODP and an OBServer node, in seconds. Default value: 5. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| server_tcp_keepcnt | The maximum number of keepalive packets to be sent for the TCP connection between an ODP and an OBServer node. The default value is `5`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| client_sock_option_flag_out | The binary-bit parameter for the TCP connection between ODP and a client.<li>If bit 0 is 1, no_delay is enabled.<li>If bit 1 is 1, keepalive is enabled. <li>If bit 2 is 1, linger_on is enabled.<br>The default value of this parameter varies based on the versions of ODP:<li>In ODP V1.8.X, the default value is `0`, which indicates that no feature is enabled.<li>In ODP V3.X, the default value is `2`, which indicates that bit 1 is 1 and keepalive is enabled. | We recommend that you set the value to `3`, which indicates that both bit 0 and bit 1 are 1, and no_delay and keepalive are enabled. |
| client_tcp_keepidle | The idle time before a keepalive packet is sent for the TCP connection between ODP and a client, in seconds. Default value: 5. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| client_tcp_keepintvl | The interval between two keepalive packets for the TCP connection between ODP and a client, in seconds. Default value: 5. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| client_tcp_keepcnt | The maximum number of keepalive packets to be sent for the TCP connection between ODP and a client. The default value is `5`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
