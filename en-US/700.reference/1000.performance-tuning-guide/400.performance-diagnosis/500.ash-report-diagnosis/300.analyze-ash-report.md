# Analyze ASH reports

After generating an ASH report, you can view its content to find the possible causes of transient performance issues.

## Report content

An ASH report records the sampling start and end time, analysis start and end time, diagnosis time, sample size, event quantity, and average number of active sessions. It also outputs information of modules including Top User Events, Top Events P1/P2/P3 Value, Top Phase of Execution, Top SQL with Top Events, Top SQL with Top Blocking Events, Complete List of SQL Text, Top Sessions, Top Blocking Sessions, and Top latches. You can analyze the performance in the target scope for the target object in different dimensions, such as the time, session, module, operation, or SQL statement.

### Top User Events

Top User Events lists the top wait events in the user process that accounted for the highest percentage of sampled session activities in multiple dimensions, such as event, event type, number of sampled events, and the percentage of wait time in the total time.
<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>CPU + Wait for CPU: normal events. </li>
  <li>sync rpc: events of synchronous waiting for RPC network packets. </li>
  </ul>
</main>

### Top Events P1/P2/P3 Value

Top Events P1/P2/P3 Value shows the parameter values of the wait events that account for the largest percentage of the sampled session activities, in order of percentage of total wait time (%Events). For each wait event, the values of p1, p2, and p3 correspond to the wait event parameters in the Parameter 1, Parameter 2, and Parameter 3 columns.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>CPU + Wait for CPU: normal events. </li>
  <li>sync rpc: events of synchronous waiting for RPC network packets. </li>
  </ul>
</main>

### Top Phase of Execution

Top Phase of Execution shows a comparison among the sampled sessions by the execution phase, the percentage of active sessions, the sample count, and the average number of active sessions. Execution phases, such as parsing and execution phases of SQL, PL/SQL, and Java, are sorted by the percentage of activities.

### Top SQL with Top Events

Top SQL with Top Events shows the SQL statements that account for the highest percentage of sampled session activities and the most common wait events encountered by these SQL statements. The Sampled # of Executions column shows the different execution counts of a particular SQL statement that were sampled.

### Top SQL with Top Blocking Events

Top SQL with Top Blocking Events displays the information about the blocked sessions. You can determine which part of the SQL execution is the most time-consuming based on the information in this module.

### Complete List of SQL Text

Complete List of SQL Text shows the full text content of the SQL statements in Top SQL with Top Events and Top SQL with Top Blocking Events.

### Top Sessions

Top Sessions sorts and counts active sessions in the session dimension. You can identify sessions with potential issues based on the sampled session ID, percentage of active sessions, event type, number of events, percentage of events, current user, and the sampled activity state.

### Top Blocking Sessions

Top Blocking Sessions shows the blocked sessions with the highest percentage of sampled session activities.

### Top Latches

Top Latches shows latches with the highest percentage in the sampled session activities.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>As a simple low-level serialization mechanism, latch is used to protect the structure of shared data in global zones.<br>
For example, latches can protect the data structures of a list of users currently accessing the database and the blocks in the buffer cache. A server or background process gets a latch in a very short time while operating or viewing one of these structures. A latch is implemented on the operating system, which determines whether and how long the process waits for the latch in particular. </p>
