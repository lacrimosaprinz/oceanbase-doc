# MATERIAL

The `MATERIAL` operator materializes the data output of subsequent operators.

OceanBase Database executes plans based on streaming data. Sometimes, however, an operator cannot execute a plan until subsequent operators have all data output. Therefore, a `MATERIAL` operator is added to materialize all the data. The `MATERIAL` operator can also dispense with the need for repeated execution of a subplan.

In the following example, when a `NESTED-LOOP JOIN` operator is executed on tables `t1` and `t2`, repeated scans are required for the table on the right side. In this case, a `MATERIAL` operator can be added to the table on the right side to save all data of table `t2`.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE t2(c1 INT ,c2 INT ,c3 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT  /*+ORDERED USE_NL(T2)*/* FROM t1,t2 WHERE t1.c1=t2.c1;

Query Plan:
===========================================
|ID|OPERATOR        |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST  |
-------------------------------------------
|0 |NESTED-LOOP JOIN|    |2970     |277377|
|1 | TABLE SCAN     |t1  |3        |37    |
|2 | MATERIAL       |    |100000   |176342|
|3 |  TABLE SCAN    |t2  |100000   |70683 |
===========================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [t1.c3], [t2.c1], [t2.c2], [t2.c3]), filter(nil),
      conds([t1.c1 = t2.c1]), nl_params_(nil)
  1 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [t1.c3]), filter(nil),
      access([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [t1.c3]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([t2.c1], [t2.c2], [t2.c3]), filter(nil)
  3 - output([t2.c1], [t2.c2], [t2.c3]), filter(nil),
      access([t2.c1], [t2.c2], [t2.c3]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, Operator 2 `MATERIAL` in the execution plan saves data of table `t2` to dispense with the need for scanning table `t2` from the disk for every join operation. The `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `MATERIAL` operator.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | The output expressions of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator. In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `MATERIAL` operator.  |
