# JOIN

`JOIN` operators join data in two tables based on specified conditions.

Joins are classified into three types: inner join, outer join, and semi/anti join.

OceanBase Database supports the following `JOIN` operators: `NESTED-LOOP JOIN`, `MERGE JOIN`, and `HASH JOIN`.

## NESTED-LOOP JOIN

In the following example, queries Q1 and Q2 use `NESTED-LOOP JOIN` based on the hint. Operator 0 is a `NESTED-LOOP JOIN` operator and has two subnodes: operators 1 and 2. The execution logic of this operator is as follows:

1. Run Operator 1 to read a row.

2. Run Operator 2 to read all rows.

3. Join the result sets of the operators 1 and 2, and apply the filter condition to export the results.

4. Repeat Step 1 until Operator 1 stops iteration.


```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE t2 (d1 INT, d2 INT, PRIMARY KEY (d1));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

Q1:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+USE_NL(t1, t2)*/ t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE c2 = d2;

Query Plan:
============================================

|2 | MATERIAL        |    |999      |1519  |
|3 |  TABLE FULL SCAN|T2  |999      |647   |
============================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T1.C2 + T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      conds([T1.C2 = T2.D2]), nl_params_(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T2.D2]), filter(nil)
  3 - output([T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D2]), partitions(p0)
```

The `MATERIAL` operator materializes the data output of subsequent operators. For more information, see [MATERIAL](../200.execution-plan-operator/1000.MATERIAL.md).

```sql
Q2:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+USE_NL(t1, t2)*/ t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE c1 = d1;

Query Plan:
| ==========================================
|ID|OPERATOR        |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST |
------------------------------------------
|0 |NESTED-LOOP JOIN|    |990      |37346|
|1 | TABLE FULL SCAN|T1  |999      |669  |
|2 | TABLE GET      |T2  |1        |36   |
==========================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T1.C2 + T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      conds(nil), nl_params_([T1.C1])
  1 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `NESTED-LOOP JOIN` operator.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|------------|------------------|
| output | The output expressions of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator. In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `NESTED-LOOP JOIN` operator.  |
| conds | The join conditions. For example, the join condition in query Q1 is `t1.c2 = t2.d2`.  |
| nl_params_ | The pushdown parameters generated based on the data of the table on the left of the `NESTED-LOOP JOIN` operator. For example, the pushdown parameter in query Q2 is `t1.c1`. For the iteration of each row of the table on the left, `NESTED-LOOP JOIN` creates a parameter based on `nl_params` and, based on this parameter and the original join condition `c1 = d1`, creates a filter condition applicable to the table on the right: `d1 = ?`. The filter condition is pushed down to the table on the right, extracting the query range of the index. The query range is the range of data to be scanned. In query Q2, Operator 2 is a `TABLE GET` operator because of the pushdown condition `d1=?`.  |

In the following example, no join condition is specified in query Q3. Operator 0 is displayed as `NESTED-LOOP JOIN CARTESIAN`, which is logically a `NESTED-LOOP JOIN` operator with no join conditions.

```sql
Q3:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2;
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
| =====================================================
|ID|OPERATOR                  |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST  |
-----------------------------------------------------
|0 |NESTED-LOOP JOIN CARTESIAN|    |998001   |747480|
|1 | TABLE FULL SCAN          |T1  |999      |647   |
|2 | MATERIAL                 |    |999      |1519  |
|3 | TABLE FULL SCAN          |T2  |999      |647   |
=====================================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T1.C2 + T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      conds(nil), nl_params_(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T2.D2]), filter(nil)
  3 - output([T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D2]), partitions(p0)
```

## MERGE JOIN

In the following example, query Q4 uses `MERGE JOIN` by adding the hint `USE_MERGE`. Operator 0 is a `MERGE JOIN` operator and has two subnodes: operators 1 and 3. The operator merges data of the left and right subnodes, and therefore requires that the data of the two subnodes be sorted in relation to the join column.

Take query Q4 as an example. The join condition is `t1.c2 = t2.d2`, which means sorting data of `t1` by `c2`, and data of `t2` by `d2`. In query Q4, the output of Operator 2 is not sorted, and the output of Operator 4 is sorted by `d1`. Both of them do not meet the sorting requirements of a merge join. Therefore, operators 1 and 3 are assigned for sorting.

```sql
Q4:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+USE_MERGE(t1, t2)*/ t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE c2 = d2 AND c1 + d1 > 10;

Query Plan:
| ======================================
|ID|OPERATOR    |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST |
--------------------------------------
|0 |MERGE JOIN      |    |3261     |14199|
|1 |SORT            |    |999      |4505 |
|2 |TABLE FULL SCAN |T1  |999      |669  |
|3 |SORT            |    |999      |4483 |
|4 |TABLE FULL  SCAN|T2  |999      |647  |
==========================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T1.C2 + T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([T1.C2 = T2.D2]), other_conds([T1.C1 + T2.D1 > 10])
  1 - output([T1.C2], [T1.C1]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C2, ASC])
  2 - output([T1.C2], [T1.C1]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2], [T1.C1]), partitions(p0)
  3 - output([T2.D2], [T2.D1]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T2.D2, ASC])
  4 - output([T2.D2], [T2.D1]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D2], [T2.D1]), partitions(p0)
```

In the following example, the join condition in query Q5 is `t1.c1 = t2.d1`, which means sorting data of `t1` by `c1`, and data of `t2` by `d1`. In this execution plan, the primary table scan is performed for `t2`, and the results are sorted by `d1`. Therefore, it is unnecessary to assign an additional `SORT` operator. Ideally, proper indexes are selected for tables on the left and right of the join, and the data order specified by the indexes can meet the requirements of a merge join. In this case, no `SORT` operator is needed.

```sql
Q5:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+USE_MERGE(t1, t2)*/ t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE c1 = d1;

Query Plan:
| =====================================
|ID|OPERATOR    |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
-------------------------------------
|0 |MERGE JOIN       |    |990      |6096|
|1 | SORT            |    |999      |4505|
|2 |  TABLE FULL SCAN|T1  |999      |669 |
|3 | TABLE FULL SCAN |T2  |999      |647 |
==========================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T1.C2 + T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([T1.C1 = T2.D1]), other_conds(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C2], [T1.C1]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C1, ASC])
  2 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  3 - output([T2.D1], [T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D1], [T2.D2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `MERGE JOIN` operator.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | The output expressions of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator. In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `MERGE JOIN` operator.  |
| equal_conds | The equality join conditions for `MERGE JOIN`. The result sets of the subnodes on the left and right must be sorted in relation to the join column.  |
| other_conds | Other join conditions. For example, query Q4 has an additional condition `t1.c1 + t2.d1 > 10`.  |

## HASH JOIN

In the following example, query Q6 uses `HASH JOIN` based on the `USE_HASH` hint. Operator 0 is a `HASH JOIN` operator and has two subnodes: operators 1 and 2. The execution logic of this operator is as follows:

1. Read data from the subnode on the left to generate a hash value based on the join column, such as `t1.c1`, and then create a hash table.

2. Read data from the subnode on the right to generate a hash value based on the join column, such as `t2.d1`, and try to join with the data of `t1` in the corresponding hash table.

```sql
Q6:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+USE_HASH(t1, t2)*/ t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE c1 = d1 AND c2 + d2 > 1;

Query Plan:
| ====================================
|ID|OPERATOR   |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
------------------------------------
|0 |HASH JOIN       |    |330      |4850|
|1 | TABLE FULL SCAN|T1  |999      |669 |
|2 | TABLE FULL SCAN|T2  |999      |647 |
=========================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T1.C2 + T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([T1.C1 = T2.D1]), other_conds([T1.C2 + T2.D2 > 1])
  1 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T2.D1], [T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D1], [T2.D2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `HASH JOIN` operator.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | The output expressions of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator. In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `HASH JOIN` operator.  |
| equal_conds | The equality join conditions. The join columns on the left and right sides are used to calculate the hash value.  |
| other_conds | Other join conditions. For example, query Q6 has an additional join condition `t1.c2 + t2.d2 > 1`.  |
