# GROUP BY

`GROUP BY` operators group and aggregate data in SQL statements.

Since hash and merge algorithms are used for data grouping, `GROUP BY` operators also fall into the following types: `HASH GROUP BY` and `MERGE GROUP BY`. For a newly generated execution plan, the SQL optimizer selects from these two `GROUP BY` operators based on cost evaluation.

General aggregate functions (`SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, and `STDDEV`) are also executed by assigning the `GROUP BY` operator. However, if an SQL statement contains only aggregate functions but no `GROUP BY`, the `SCALAR GROUP BY` operator is assigned. In that sense, `GROUP BY` operators can be divided into three types: `SCALAR GROUP BY`, `HASH GROUP BY`, and `MERGE GROUP BY`.

## SCALAR GROUP BY

Example 1: an execution plan that contains a `SCALAR GROUP BY` operator

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2, 2);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(3, 3);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

Q1:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT SUM(c1) FROM t1;

Query Plan:
| ========================================
|ID|OPERATOR       |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
----------------------------------------
|0 |SCALAR GROUP BY|    |1        |37  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN    |T1  |3        |37  |
========================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T_FUN_SUM(T1.C1)]), filter(nil),
      group(nil), agg_func([T_FUN_SUM(T1.C1)])
  1 - output([T1.C1]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section for query Q1 shows in detail the output information of the `SCALAR GROUP BY` operator.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | The output expressions of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator. In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `SCALAR GROUP BY` operator.  |
| group | The columns to be grouped. For example, query Q1 contains the `SCALAR GROUP BY` operator. Therefore, the value of this field is `nil`.  |
| agg_func | The aggregate functions involved. For example, query Q1 is to sum up the data in column `c1` of table `t1`. Therefore, the value is `T_FUN_SUM(t1.c1)`.  |

## HASH GROUP BY

Example 2: an execution plan that contains a `HASH GROUP BY` operator

```sql
Q2:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT SUM(c2) FROM t1 GROUP BY c1 HAVING SUM(c2) > 2;

Query Plan:
| ======================================
|ID|OPERATOR     |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
--------------------------------------
|0 |HASH GROUP BY|    |1        |40  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN  |T1  |3        |37  |
======================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T_FUN_SUM(T1.C2)]), filter([T_FUN_SUM(T1.C2) > 2]),
      group([T1.C1]), agg_func([T_FUN_SUM(T1.C2)])
  1 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section for query Q2 shows in detail the output information of the `HASH GROUP BY` operator.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | The output expressions of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator. Because the setting requires that the sum of column `c2` after grouping is greater than 2, the filter is `T_FUN_SUM(t1.c2) > 2`.  |
| group | The columns to be grouped. For example, query Q2 has a `HASH GROUP BY` operator. Therefore, the value of this field is `nil`.  |
| agg_func | The aggregate functions involved. For example, query Q2 is to sum up the data in column `c1` of table `t1`. Therefore, the value is `T_FUN_SUM(t1.c1)`.  |

## MERGE GROUP BY

Example 3: an execution plan that contains a `MERGE GROUP BY` operator

```sql
Q3:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+NO_USE_HASH_AGGREGATION*/SUM(c2) FROM t1 GROUP BY c1 HAVING SUM(c2) > 2;

Query Plan:
| =======================================
|ID|OPERATOR      |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
---------------------------------------
|0 |MERGE GROUP BY|    |1        |45  |
|1 | SORT         |    |3        |44  |
|2 |  TABLE SCAN  |T1  |3        |37  |
=======================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T_FUN_SUM(T1.C2)]), filter([T_FUN_SUM(T1.C2) > 2]),
      group([T1.C1]), agg_func([T_FUN_SUM(T1.C2)])
  1 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C1, ASC])
  2 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section for query Q3 shows in detail the information of the `MERGE GROUP BY` operator. It shows that the `MERGE GROUP BY` operator was selected for the execution plan that was generated by the same SQL statement, and the basic information of the operator was the same as that of other `GROUP BY` operators, except for the algorithm selected for grouping in the execution. Additionally, Operator 2 `TABLE SCAN` in the example returns an unsorted result, since the `MERGE GROUP BY` operator is used, a `SORT` operator must be assigned.
