# WINDOW FUNCTION

The `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator implements SQL analytic functions, also known as window functions, to calculate the results of relevant rows in a window.

A window function differs from an aggregate function in that the latter returns only one row from a group of data, while a window function returns multiple rows from a group. Each row in the group is the result of a window-based logical calculation. Therefore, in the execution of an SQL statement that contains a `WINDOW FUNCTION`, whose format is generally `OVER(...)`, a `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator is assigned while an execution plan is generated.

Example: an execution plan that contains a `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 1);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2, 2);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(3, 3);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

Q1:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT MAX(c1) OVER(PARTITION BY c1 ORDER BY c2) FROM t1;

Query Plan:
| ========================================
|ID|OPERATOR       |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
----------------------------------------
|0 |WINDOW FUNCTION|    |3        |45  |
|1 | SORT          |    |3        |44  |
|2 |  TABLE SCAN   |T1  |3        |37  |
========================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T_FUN_MAX(T1.C1)]), filter(nil),
      win_expr(T_FUN_MAX(T1.C1)), partition_by([T1.C1]), order_by([T1.C2, ASC]), window_type(RANGE), upper(UNBOUNDED PRECEDING), lower(CURRENT ROW)
  1 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C1, ASC], [T1.C2, ASC])
  2 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```

When `ORDER BY` or `PARTITION BY` is specified in a window function, a `SORT` operator is assigned at the subsequent layer to return the sorting result to the `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator.

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section for query Q1 shows in detail the output information of the `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|--------------|--------------------|
| output | The output expressions of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator. In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `WINDOW FUNCTION` operator.  |
| win_expr | The aggregate function to be used in the window. <br>For example, query Q1 obtains the maximum value of column `c1`, so the function is `T_FUN_MAX(t1.c1)`.  |
| partition_by | Specifies how groups are partitioned in the window. <br>For example, query Q1 is partitioned by column `c1`, so the value is `t1.c1`.  |
| order_by | Specifies how rows are sorted in the window. <br>For example, query Q1 requires ordering by column `c2`, so the value is `t1.c2`.  |
| window_type | The type of the window, which could be either `RANGE` or `ROWS`: <ul><li> `RANGE`: In the default `RANGE` mode, the upper and lower boundaries of the window are calculated based on logical offsets. </li>   <li> `ROWS`: In the `ROWS` mode, the upper and lower boundaries of the window are calculated based on physical offsets.  </li> </ul><br>For example, the default `RANGE` mode is selected in query Q1 as no window type is specified.  |
| upper | Sets the upper boundary of the window. Valid values: <ul><li> `UNBOUNDED`: No boundary is specified, and the maximum value is used (default). </li>   <li> `CURRENT ROW`: starts from the current row. A numeric value indicates the number of rows to move from the current.  </li>  <li>`PRECEDING`: sets the boundary in the preceding rows. </li>  <li>`FOLLOWING`: sets the boundary in the following rows. </li> </ul><br>For example, the upper boundary of query Q1 can be set to a combination of `UNBOUNDED` and `PRECEDING`, indicating that no upper boundary is specified.  |
| lower | The lower boundary of the window. The attribute settings are the same as those of the `upper` parameter. <br>For example, the lower boundary in query Q1 is set to the current row.  |
