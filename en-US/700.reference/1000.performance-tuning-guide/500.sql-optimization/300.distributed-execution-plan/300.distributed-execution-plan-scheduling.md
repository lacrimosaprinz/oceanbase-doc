# Schedule distributed execution plans

OceanBase Database schedules query plans based on a simple scheduling model.

At the final stage of execution plan generation, an execution plan is divided into several subplans by taking `EXCHANGE` nodes as the boundaries. Each subplan is encapsulated as a data flow object (DFO). If the degree of parallelism (DOP) is greater than 1, two DFOs are scheduled at a time to traverse the DFO tree. If the DOP equals 1, each DFO saves the generated data to the intermediate result manager and then traverses the DFO tree through postorder traversal.

## Single-DFO scheduling

Example: Single-DFO scheduling for a query plan of which the DOP is 1.

As shown in the following figure, the DFO tree, except for the ROOT DFO, is divided into DFOs 0, 1, and 2. The scheduling order of postorder traversal is 0 \> 1 \> 2, by which the iteration of the entire plan tree is implemented.

In the following figure, the DFO tree, except for the ROOT DFO, is divided into three DFOs: 0, 1, and 2. The system prioritizes DFO 0 during scheduling. DFOs 1 and 2 are sequentially scheduled and executed after the execution of DFO 0.
