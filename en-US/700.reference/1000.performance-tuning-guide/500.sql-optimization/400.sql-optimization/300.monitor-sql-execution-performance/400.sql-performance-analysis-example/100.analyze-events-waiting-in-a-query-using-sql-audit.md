# Use SQL Audit to analyze wait events in a query

SQL Audit records the following information about wait events:

* The wait time of the four classes of wait events, each of which is respectively recorded in the `APPLICATION_WAIT_TIME`, `CONCURRENCY_WAIT_TIME`, `USER_IO_WAIT_TIME`, and `SCHEDULE_TIME` fields. Each class involves many specific wait events.

* The name of the most time-consuming wait event, which is indicated by `EVENT`, and the time consumed, which is indicated by `WAIT_TIME_MICRO`.

* The number of occurrences of all wait events, which is indicated by `TOTAL_WAITS`, and the total time consumed, which is indicated by `TOTAL_WAIT_TIME_MICRO`.

If a large amount of time is consumed by wait events, you can check `EVENT` for the most time-consuming wait event and locate the cause of the problem.

In the following example, I/O wait is the main cause of time consumption.

```sql
obclient> SELECT SQL_ID, ELAPSED_TIME, QUEUE_TIME, GET_PLAN_TIME, EXECUTE_TIME,
     APPLICATION_WAIT_TIME, CONCURRENCY_WAIT_TIME, USER_IO_WAIT_TIME, SCHEDULE_TIME,
     EVENT, WAIT_CLASS,  WAIT_TIME_MICRO, TOTAL_WAIT_TIME_MICRO FROM V$OB_SQL_AUDIT
     WHERE TRACE_ID = 'YB42AC1E87E6-0005B8AB2D578471'\G;
