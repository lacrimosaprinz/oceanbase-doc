# Analyze queries related to distributed plans

You can analyze queries related to distributed plans by performing the following steps:

1. Query the `(G)V$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT` and `(G)V$OB_SQL_AUDIT` views and check whether the plan is a distributed plan.

2. Analyze the correctness of the execution plan.

3. Query the `(G)V$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view by using `trace_id` and check the time consumed for executing each subplan. Each execution of a subplan by using a remote procedure call (RPC) corresponds to an SQL Audit record. You can analyze the SQL Audit record to locate the problem.

In the following example, `is_executor_rpc = 1` indicates an SQL Audit record for a subplan execution. This record stores information related to that execution. `is_executor_rpc = 0` indicates an SQL Audit record for a thread that accepted the SQL request. This record contains information about the SQL execution process, including information about the SQL request and the obtained execution plan.

```sql
obclient> SELECT/*+ PARALLEL(15)*/sql_id, is_executor_rpc, elapsed_time
           FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT WHERE trace_id = 'YB420AB74FC6-00056349D323483A';
