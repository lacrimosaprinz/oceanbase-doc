# View and analyze the shape of an execution plan

To view and analyze the shape of an execution plan, perform the following steps:

1. Execute the `EXPLAIN` statement to view the shape of the execution plan, or view the cached execution plan by real-time execution plan display. For more information, see [Introduction to SQL execution plans](../../../200.sql-execution-plan/100.introduction-to-sql-execution-plans.md) and [Real-time execution plan display](../../../200.sql-execution-plan/500.real-time-execution-plan-display.md).

2. Analyze the shape of the execution plan to determine whether the selection of the index, join order, and join algorithm is reasonable and correct. For more information, see [Access path](../../600.query-optimization/100.access-path/100.access-path-overview.md), [Join order](../../600.query-optimization/200.join-algorithm/400.join-order.md), and [Join algorithms](../../600.query-optimization/200.join-algorithm/200.join-algorithm.md).
