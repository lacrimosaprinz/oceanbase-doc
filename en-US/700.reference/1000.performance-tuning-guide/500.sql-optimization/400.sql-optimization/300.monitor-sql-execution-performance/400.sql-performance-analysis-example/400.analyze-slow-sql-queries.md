# Analyze slow SQL queries

You can analyze a slow SQL query in the following ways:

* View the statistics on the SQL query in SQL Audit and analyze the execution plan of the SQL query. For more information, see [Analyze SQL queries that cause an abrupt RT jitter](../400.sql-performance-analysis-example/200.sql-statement-that-analyzes-sudden-jitter-of-rt.md).

* Check whether the execution plan is correct. For more information, see [View and analyze the shape of an execution plan](../400.sql-performance-analysis-example/300.view-and-analyze-the-execution-plan.md).
