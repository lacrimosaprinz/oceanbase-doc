# Query SQL traffic distribution and QPS

In some scenarios, unbalanced loads between OBServer nodes may cause performance bottlenecks. You can execute the following statement to query SQL traffic distribution and QPS on the OBServer nodes:

```sql
obclient> SELECT/*+ PARALLEL(15)*/t2.zone, t1.svr_ip,  COUNT(*) AS RPC_COUNT,
AVG(t1.elapsed_time), AVG(t1.queue_time)  
FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` t1, __all_server t2  
WHERE t1.svr_ip = t2.svr_ip
AND tenant_id = 1001
AND SQL_ID = 'BF7AA13A28DF50BA5C33FF19F1DBD8A9'
AND IS_EXECUTOR_RPC = 0    
AND request_time > (time_to_usec(now()) - 1000000)    
AND request_time < time_to_usec(now())
GROUP BY t1.svr_ip;
```
