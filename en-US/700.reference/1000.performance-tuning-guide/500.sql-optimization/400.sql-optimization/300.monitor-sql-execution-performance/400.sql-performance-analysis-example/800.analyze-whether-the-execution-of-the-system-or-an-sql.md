# Analyze whether an unusually large number of remote execution requests exist in the system or the execution of an SQL statement

You can execute the following SQL statement to analyze how many times different types of plans are executed in a certain period:

```javascript
obclient> SELECT COUNT(*),plan_type FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT WHERE tenant_id = 1001         
   AND  IS_EXECUTOR_RPC = 0          
   AND  request_time > (time_to_usec(now()) - 10000000)         
   AND  request_time < time_to_usec(now())
   GROUP BY plan_type;
+----------+-----------+
| COUNT(*) | plan_type |
+----------+-----------+
|     2054 |         1 |
|      138 |         0 |
+----------+-----------+
2 rows in set
```

Generally, a large number of remote execution requests may be the result of a follower-to-leader switchover, or inaccurate routing by OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP).
