# Achieve high performance with Sysbench on OceanBase Database: deployment and troubleshooting

This topic provides comprehensive instructions for installing and deploying OceanBase Database, creating business tenants, and maximizing performance when using Sysbench. It aims to assist OceanBase Database users in achieving high performance during Sysbench testing. Furthermore, it includes case studies on performance issues to serve as a reference and aid in resolving potential performance problems.

## Quick troubleshooting procedure for Sysbench issues

### TPS of Sysbench is lower than expected

Perform the following steps to locate the issue:

1. Analyze Sysbench parameters.

   We recommend that you start with parameters in the Sysbench running command.

   * If `--rand-type` is not specified or its value is set to `special`, you can set or change its value to `uniform` to reduce data lock contention.
   * If the number of tables or the table size is too small, you can increase the size of the dataset. For example, you can set `tables=100` and `table_size=1000000`.
   * In a `read_write` or `write_only` scenario, execute the following statement to check whether deadlocks exist:

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.cdb_ob_deadlock_event_history ORDER BY create_time DESC LIMIT 10;
      ```

2. Check whether the connection meets the testing requirements.

   * If the primary zone is a single zone and you are directly connected to an OBServer node, check whether this node is a leader.
   * If the primary zone is set to `RANDOM`, connect to an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) to run the benchmark.

   1. Query the tenant information.

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.dba_ob_tenants;
      ```

   2. Query the tenant leader.

      ```sql
      SELECT svr_ip, sql_port, count(1) FROM oceanbase.cdb_ob_ls_locations WHERE tenant_id=1 AND role='leader' GROUP BY svr_ip;
      ```

3. Check the CPU overhead.

   If the Sysbench parameters and client connection method are correct, you can check the CPU utilization.

   * Check the CPU utilization of threads.

      ```shell
      top -H -p pidof observer
      ```

      If each business thread can almost fully use a CPU core, check whether the number of threads approximates the number of CPU cores.

      * If the business threads (such as T1002_L0_G2) are far fewer than CPU cores and the total CPU overhead is far below the upper limit of the server, the issue is probably caused by too few CPU cores. In this case, you can check the tenant creation command and check whether the value of `cpu_count` is too small.
      * If the total CPU overhead approaches the upper limit of the server, the server has reached its performance limit. In this case, you must run Sysbench on a server with higher configurations to achieve higher performance.

   * Check the tenant specifications.

      ```sql
      show create tenant xxx;
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.dba_ob_resource_pools;
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.dba_ob_units;
      ```

      If no single business thread fully uses a CPU core, for example, if the CPU utilization is 20% to 50%, a bottleneck occurs somewhere else.

      * If a network thread such as RpcIO has exhausted a CPU core, the number of network threads may be too small and network communication becomes a bottleneck. In this case, you must increase the value of `net_thread_count`.
      * If none of the threads shows high CPU utilization, a hardware bottleneck may have occurred and further analysis is required.

4. Analyze the hardware causes.

   If you confirm that the issue is not caused by CPU-related factors, perform the following steps to check the disk and network:

   1. Check the maximum bandwidth of the NIC and verify whether the network bandwidth has become a bottleneck during a test. You can deploy Sysbench on an OBServer node for testing.
   2. Check the network latency by using the ping command. A high latency may lead to slow SQL execution.
   3. Check the maximum bandwidth for 16 KB writes in the log disk by using a flexible I/O (FIO) tester. Verify that the disk I/O is a bottleneck during testing. You can replace the SSD or non-volatile memory (NVM) for testing.

   Run the following command to view the network I/O:

   ```shell
   sar -n DEV 1
   ```

   Run the following command to view the maximum bandwidth of the NIC:

   ```shell
   ## (eth0 is the NIC name.)
   ethtool eth0
   ```

5. Analyze other possible causes.

   If the issue is not caused by the preceding factors, you can check some special cases. For example, you can check whether the test period conflicts with backend tasks of the OBServer node.

   According to the feedback of a customer, two sets of data were below expectations during a business test. No obvious issue related to configurations was found. It turned out that the customer performed the test at 2:00 in the morning, at which OceanBase Database automatically performed daily compactions. Therefore, the database performance was significantly affected.

### TPS of Sysbench fluctuates and drops to 0 sometimes

#### TPS occasionally decreases and the decrease is stable

* Possible causes: OceanBase Database periodically performs minor and major compactions, which consumes CPU resources and affects business threads. A tenant that has more CPU cores suffers less impact. For a tenant with four CPU cores and 8 GB of memory, the TPS may decrease by 80% during minor compactions. For a tenant with 32 CPU cores and 64 GB of memory, the TPS may decrease by 10% during minor compactions.
* Solutions:

   1. Increase the value of `max_cpu` in the resource unit for the tenant.
   2. Increase the CPU concurrency for the tenant.

      ```sql
      alter system set cpu_quota_concurrency=4 tenant = xxx;
      ```

   3. Reduce the threads intended for minor compactions (`merge_thread_count`) or lower the thread priority (`compaction_high_thread_score`, `compaction_mid_thread_score`, or `compaction_low_thread_score`). This can reduce the unit time overhead of minor compactions at a cost in time. The overall overhead of minor compactions remains unchanged.

#### TPC decreases to 0 and occasionally increases to more than 0

* Possible causes: A deadlock occurs and `mysql-ignore-errors=1062,1213,6002;` is set for Sysbench.
* Solutions:
   1. Check whether a deadlock exists.

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.cdb_ob_deadlock_event_history ORDER BY create_time DESC LIMIT 10;
      ```

   2. If yes, perform the following steps:

      1. Set `--rand-type=uniform` for Sysbench.
      2. Increase the size of the dataset. For example, you can set `tables=100` and `table_size=1000000`. The default value of `table_size` is `10000`.

#### TPS decreases to 0 and remains 0 afterward

* Possible causes: A deadlock occurs and is not detected. In addition, the timeout period is set to a large value. As a result, after the TPS decreases to 0, no error is returned, the thread does not exit, and the TPS does not return to normal.
* Solutions:
   1. Check whether a deadlock exists.

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.cdb_ob_deadlock_event_history ORDER BY create_time DESC LIMIT 10;
      ```

   2. If yes, perform the following steps:

      1. Set `--rand-type=uniform` for Sysbench.
      2. Increase the size of the dataset. For example, you can set `tables=100` and `table_size=1000000`. The default value of `table_size` is `10000`.

#### TPS decreases to 0 and returns to normal after a couple of seconds

* Possible causes: The clog disk is full and no more data can be written to the clog disk. As a result, the TPS decreases to 0 and returns to normal after the space on the clog disk is recycled.
* Solutions: Check the disk usage of the tenant.

   ```sql
   SELECT tenant_id, svr_ip, svr_port, log_disk_in_use, log_disk_size FROM oceanbase.gv$ob_units;
   ```

   Allocate more disk space to the tenant if the disk space is insufficient.

If the issue persists, contact OceanBase Technical Support.

### Sysbench errors

#### TPS decreases to 0 and occasionally increases to more than 0, and the 6002 or 1213 error is returned sometimes

* Possible causes: A deadlock occurs, the size of the dataset is too small, or the `rand-type` parameter is not specified. The default value `Special` is used when this parameter is not specified, which will cause centralized keys. The thread does not exit because most SQL requests are in a deadlock. In this case, the thread will wait for the SQL requests to complete execution.
* Solutions:
   1. Check whether a deadlock exists.

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.cdb_ob_deadlock_event_history ORDER BY create_time DESC LIMIT 10;
      ```

   2. If yes, perform the following steps:

      1. Set `--rand-type=uniform` for Sysbench.
      2. Increase the size of the dataset. For example, you can set `tables=100` and `table_size=1000000`. The default value of `table_size` is `10000`.

#### Error 1062 is returned

* Possible causes: The 1062 error indicates primary key or unique key conflicts. Primary key conflicts are possible because Sysbench generates data randomly.
* Solutions: Set `--mysql-ignore-errors=1062` for Sysbench.

#### Error 1213 is returned

* Possible causes: A deadlock occurs and some transactions in the deadlock are terminated.
* Solutions: A deadlock may still occur even if the dataset is very large and `--rand-type=uniform` is specified. Therefore, you can set `--mysql-ignore-errors=1062,1213` to ignore deadlocks.

#### Error 6002 is returned

* Possible causes: The 6002 error may be caused by a deadlock.
* Solutions: Increase the size of the dataset and set `--rand-type=uniform` to reduce lock contention. Set `--mysql-ignore-errors=1062,1213,6002` for Sysbench.

#### Error 4012 is returned

* Possible causes: Lock contention is severe, a deadlock occurs, or the OBServer node has poor performance but the client has high stress.
* Solutions: Increase the timeout period, in Î¼s.

   ```sql
   set global ob_query_timeout = 50000000000;
   ```

#### Error 5930 is returned

* Possible causes: `--db-ps-mode=auto` is set to enable SQL precompilation but OceanBase Database does not fully support precompilation.
* Solutions:

   * Increase the value of the `open_cursors` parameter. For example, execute `alter system set open_cursors=65535;`.
   * Set `--db-ps-mode=disable;` to disable SQL precompilation.

#### Other errors

* Possible causes: OceanBase Database may have bugs.
* Solutions: Record the error logs and contact OceanBase Technical Support for assistance.

## Complete troubleshooting procedure

If you cannot locate the cause of an issue in the quick troubleshooting procedure, you can perform the complete troubleshooting procedure. If you have any questions, you can see other sections of this topic or the reference topics by clicking the corresponding links. If the issue persists, contact OceanBase Technical Support for assistance.

Here is the general analysis procedure:

1. Check the hardware resources. If CPU, memory, or disk resources are insufficient, the performance will be directly affected, and the TPS may even decrease to 0.
2. Check the tenant configurations. You cannot make full use of the hardware with insufficient resources.
3. Check the Sysbench parameters. The TPS is directly affected by the number of threads. A small dataset size or centralized data distribution will cause lock contention and even deadlocks.
4. Check whether the OBServer node has bugs.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Run the commands in the following sections as needed. You do not need to run all of them. </p>
</main>

### Check the hardware

Insufficient hardware resources, such as less than four CPU cores or 8 GB of memory, will lead to poor performance. If the disk usage is close to 100%, the write speed will be affected. A high network latency will also affect the performance.

* CPU: `lscpu`
* Memory: `top` and `cat /proc/meminfo`
* Disk: `df -h`
* Network latency: `ping ip`

### Check OceanBase Database deployment configurations

If the deployment parameters of OceanBase Database are set to small values when hardware resources on the server are sufficient, resources cannot be fully used and the performance will deteriorate. Most parameters can be dynamically adjusted and only a few parameters must be specified during deployment.

* Connect to the sys tenant and query the `GV$OB_SERVERS` view.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM GV$OB_SERVERS;
   ```

* Check the number of network threads. The `net_thread_count` parameter cannot be dynamically adjusted.

   ```sql
   show parameters where name = 'net_thread_count';
   ```

* View deployed clusters.

   ```shell
   obd cluster list
   ```

* View the configuration of a deployed cluster.

   ```shell
   obd cluster edit-config [cluster name]
   ```

Check the startup parameters of the OBServer node on the server where it resides.

```shell
ps -ef | grep observer
```

### Check tenant configurations

Check whether any resource bottleneck exists in the tenant when the OBServer node has sufficient resources.

* View the basic information about the tenant.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM oceanbase.dba_ob_tenants;
   ```

* View the tenant creation command.

   ```sql
   show create tenant [tenant name];
   ```

* View the resource pool of the tenant. You can add the `tenant_id` filter condition in the command.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM oceanbase.dba_ob_resource_pools;
   ```

* View the specifications of the corresponding resource unit.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM oceanbase.dba_ob_units;
   ```

### Check Sysbench parameters

You can check the parameters one by one in Sysbench commands based on the parameter descriptions.

### Locate a deadlock

* View deadlock records.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM oceanbase.cdb_ob_deadlock_event_history ORDER BY create_time DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

   Here, `role=victim` indicates that a transaction was terminated.

* View transaction-related SQL statements.

   ```sql
   SELECT usec_to_time(REQUEST_TIME), TRACE_ID, TX_ID, QUERY_SQL FROM gv$ob_sql_audit WHERE TX_ID=52635 ORDER BY REQUEST_TIME;
   ```

   If no related transaction is found, SQL audit is not enabled. You can verify this by checking whether the value of the `enable_sql_audit` parameter is `True`.

   ```sql
   show parameters where name = 'enable_sql_audit';
   ```

   If the value is `False`, you cannot view SQL statements related to the transaction. You can filter the logs by transaction ID to find some information.

* Query logs related to the problematic SQL statement.

   After you obtain SQL statements related to the transaction, filter logs by the trace ID of the conflicting SQL statement.

   ```shell
   grep '[trace id]' observer.log*
   ```

   You can view all logs related to this SQL statement. Generally, the last log contains the error code returned to the client.

   ```shell
   sending error packet(err=-4101
   ```

   You can also search for related logs by the trace ID of the last `commit` or `begin` command.

   ```shell
   sending error packet(err=-6002
   ```

   If no log is found, the log level is incorrect or log throttling is enabled. In this case, you must change the log level to `WDIAG` or increase the bandwidth limit for logs.

   ```sql
   alter system set syslog_level='WDIAG';
   alter system set syslog_io_bandwidth_limit='2G';
   ```

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>You cannot search for information about deadlocks that occur before you modify the parameters. </p>
  </main>

### Analyze minor and major compactions

1. View minor and major compaction tasks that take more than 5s to execute.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM GV$OB_MERGE_INFO WHERE tenant_id=1002 AND (END_TIME-START_TIME)>5 LIMIT 10;
   ```

2. View the major compaction records of a table.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM GV$OB_TABLET_COMPACTION_HISTORY WHERE TABLET_ID IN (SELECT TABLET_ID FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'sbtest1') ORDER BY START_TIME DESC;
   ```

3. Initiate a minor compaction.

   ```sql
   alter system minor freeze tenant=xxx;
   ```

Run the `top -H` command on the OBServer node to view the overhead of the MINI_MERGE and MINOR_EXE threads. The overhead information is displayed only for a short period.

### Query slow SQL statements

1. Query SQL statements that take more than 5s to execute and print all the information.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM gv$ob_sql_audit WHERE elapsed_time > 5000000 LIMIT 10;
   ```

2. Customize the key information to print.

   ```sql
   SELECT SVR_IP, SVR_PORT, SQL_EXEC_ID, TRACE_ID, TENANT_ID, SQL_ID, QUERY_SQL, PLAN_ID, PARTITION_CNT, IS_INNER_SQL, ELAPSED_TIME, EXECUTE_TIME, APPLICATION_WAIT_TIME FROM gv$ob_sql_audit WHERE elapsed_time > 5000000 ORDER BY elapsed_time DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

   If no data is found, SQL audit is not enabled.

   ```sql
   show parameters where name = 'enable_sql_audit';
   alter system set enable_sql_audit = true;
   ```

### Troubleshoot log issues

View disk usage.

```sql
SELECT tenant_id, svr_ip, svr_port, LOG_DISK_IN_USE, LOG_DISK_SIZE FROM gv$ob_units;
```

### Reproduce an issue

1. Clear earlier SQL audit records.

   ```sql
   alter system set enable_sql_audit = false;
   alter system flush sql audit global;
   ```

2. Enable SQL audit.

   ```sql
   alter system set enable_sql_audit = true;
   ```

3. Change the log level.

   ```sql
   alter system set syslog_level='WDIAG';
   ```

4. Decrease the SQL recording threshold to record more SQL statements.

   ```sql
   alter system set trace_log_slow_query_watermark = '10ms';
   ```

5. Increase the bandwidth available for system logs to avoid losing key logs due to throttling.

   ```sql
   alter system set syslog_io_bandwidth_limit='2G';
   ```

6. Increase the transaction timeout period if you do not want transactions to time out.

   ```sql
   set global ob_query_timeout = 50000000000;
   ```

Set the same parameters as in the scenario of the issue and run Sysbench.

## Configure OceanBase Database deployment parameters

### Configuration file

This section shows the configuration file for the 32C128G specifications, in which the disk space is sufficient. Assume that three OBServer nodes and one OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) are deployed. Other components such as OceanBase Agent (OBAgent) are not considered. Each OBServer node and ODP are deployed on different servers to make full use of the hardware resources to achieve higher performance.

```cpp

## Configure business tenant parameters

### Create a tenant

In OceanBase Database, you can create only user tenants. The sys tenant is automatically created when you create a cluster. The creation of a user tenant involves a series of operations. First, create a unit config, then create a resource pool based on the unit config, and finally create a tenant and specify the resource pool for it. The creation sequence is: unit config > resource pool > tenant.

For more information about how to create a tenant, see [Create a tenant](../../600.manage/200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).

#### Tenant creation command

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>If you use OBD for automatic deployment, only the sys tenant is created. You can create a dedicated tenant for performance testing to make full use of resources available on the OBServer node. </p>
</main>

The following command creates a tenant on a server with 32 CPU cores and 128 GB of memory.

```shell
sh create_perf_tenant.sh ip port
```

```cpp
mysql -c -h $1 -P $2 -uroot -e "drop resource unit unit_1;"
mysql -c -h $1 -P $2 -uroot -e "create resource unit unit_1 max_cpu 24, min_cpu 16, memory_size 64000000000, log_disk_size 40000000000, max_iops 10000000;"
mysql -c -h $1 -P $2 -uroot -e "create resource pool pool_2 unit = 'unit_1', unit_num = 1, zone_list = ('zone1','zone2','zone3');"
mysql -c -h $1 -P $2 -uroot -e "create tenant perf replica_num = 3,primary_zone='zone1', resource_pool_list=('pool_2') set ob_tcp_invited_nodes='%';"
mysql -c -h $1 -P $2 -uroot@perf -e "set global ob_query_timeout = 50000000000;"
mysql -c -h $1 -P $2 -uroot@perf -e "set global ob_trx_timeout = 50000000000;"
mysql -c -h $1 -P $2 -uroot@perf -e "set global ob_plan_cache_percentage = 20;"
mysql -c -h $1 -P $2 -uroot@perf -e "set global binlog_row_image='MINIMAL';"
mysql -c -h $1 -P $2 -uroot -e "alter system set enable_early_lock_release=true tenant = perf;"
mysql -c -h $1 -P $2 -uroot -e "alter system set cpu_quota_concurrency=2 tenant = perf;"
```

If you do not specify the tenant mode in the tenant creation command, a MySQL tenant is automatically created. To create an Oracle tenant, specify the tenant mode to Oracle.

Execute the following statement in the sys tenant. The `COMPATIBILITY_MODE` field specifies the tenant mode.

```sql
SELECT * FROM DBA_OB_TENANTS;
```

### Key tenant parameters

The following parameters are key to the performance of a tenant:

* **min_cpu**

   * Description: the minimum number of CPU cores available for the tenant (sum of `min_cpu` values of all tenants <= `cpu_count`).
   * Recommended value: `cpu_count`/2
   * Reference: For more information about the `min_cpu` parameter, see the parameter description in the **Create a unit config** section of the [Create a tenant](../../600.manage/200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md) topic.

* **max_cpu**

   * Description: the maximum number of CPU cores available for the tenant (sum of `max_cpu` values of all tenants <= `cpu_count` Ã `resource_hard_limit`/100).
   * Recommended value: `cpu_count`/2 to `cpu_count`. You can also set this parameter to the same value as `min_cpu`.
   * Reference: For more information about the `max_cpu` parameter, see the parameter description in the **Create a unit config** section of the [Create a tenant](../../600.manage/200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md) topic.

* **cpu_quota_concurrency**

   * Description: the number of concurrent threads for each CPU core (`max_cpu` Ã `cpu_quota_concurrency` = maximum number of business threads).
   * Recommended value: `4`. Generally, we recommend that you use the default value. You can change the value to `2` for CPU-intensive stress testing.
   * Reference: [cpu_quota_concurrency](../800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/400.tenant-level-configuration-items/5500.cpu_quota_concurrency.md).

* **memory_size**

   * Description: the size of memory provided by the resource unit.
   * Recommended value: 50% to 80% of the total memory. If you want to create multiple resource units, the memory is flexibly allocated.

* **log_disk_size**

   * Description: the size of the log disk
   * Recommended value: 40 GB to 80 GB. You can set a larger value, depending on the data amount.

* **primary_zone**

   * Description: the priority of allocating leaders to zones. Zones on the left and right sides of a comma share the same priority. A zone on the left side of a semicolon has a higher priority than that on the right side. For example, in `zone1,zone2,zone3`, the three zones have the same priority.
   * Recommended value:

      1. If the three servers have the same specifications and similar network latency, you can set the value to `RANDOM` to improve the performance. In this case, leaders are evenly distributed.
      2. If a server has higher performance or if you want to facilitate statistics collection and data observation, you can set the primary zone to the zone where the server resides, such as `zone1`.

## Configure global parameters in the sys tenant

You can connect to the sys tenant and modify cluster-level configurations. For example, you can change the log level or disable features that affect the performance, such as SQL audit.

```cpp
ALTER system SET enable_sql_audit=false;
select sleep(5);
ALTER system SET enable_perf_event=false;
ALTER system SET syslog_level='ERROR';
alter system set enable_record_trace_log=false;
```

## Configure Sysbench parameters

### Sysbench test process

* Installation and deployment

   For more information, see the **Install Sysbench** section in the [Run the Sysbench benchmark on OceanBase Database](../1100.performance-test/300.use-sysbench-to-test-the-performance-of-oceanbase-database.md) topic.

* Prepare data

   ```shell
   cleanup:
   sysbench oltp_read_write.lua --mysql-host=x.x.x.x --mysql-port=xxxx --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=test@xxx --mysql-password=xxx --table_size=1000000 --tables=30 --rand-type=uniform --threads=1000  --report-interval=1 --time=600 cleanup
   prepare:
   sysbench oltp_read_write.lua --mysql-host=x.x.x.x --mysql-port=xxxx --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=test@xxx --mysql-password=test --table_size=1000000 --tables=30 --rand-type=uniform --threads=1000  --report-interval=1 --time=600 prepare
   ```

* Run the test

   ```shell
   sysbench oltp_read_write.lua --mysql-host=x.x.x.x --mysql-port=xxxx --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=test@xxx --mysql-password=xxx --table_size=1000000 --tables=30 --rand-type=uniform --threads=1000  --report-interval=1 --time=600 --db-ps-mode=disable run
   ```

### Key performance parameters

Reference: [Sysbench parameters](https://github.com/wing324/helloworld_zh/blob/master/Linux/sysbench/sysbench%E5%8F%82%E6%95%B0%E8%AF%A6%E8%A7%A3.md).

* **table_size**

   * Description: the number of rows initiated for each table. The default value is `10000`.
   * Recommended value: `100000` or `1000000`.

* **tables**

   * Description: the number of initialized tables.
   * Recommended value: 30 to 100.

* **threads**

   * Description: the number of test threads.
   * Recommended value range: 500 to 2,000. More CPU cores on the test server support more threads.

* **rand-type**

   Description: the random type for test data generation. Valid values are `uniform`, `gaussian`, `special`, and `pareto`. The default value is `special`.

   1. `special`: Keys are centralized, and lock contention easily occurs.
   2. `uniform`: Data is discretely and evenly distributed. All values within the range have an equal probability of occurrence and no lock contention occurs.
   3. `gaussian`: Data is centralized near medians. This is also known as normal distribution.
   4. `pareto`: Data is centralized near the smallest values. A larger value has a lower probability of occurrence.

   Recommended value: `uniform`.

* **mysql-ignore-errors**

   * Description: the error codes ignored during the test process. When Sysbench receives an error, it immediately stops sending new requests. After Sysbench receives responses to all requests, it exits the test. Therefore, you can choose to ignore error codes related to expected errors.
   * Valid values: `1062`, `1213`, and `6002`. `1062` indicates a primary key or unique key conflict. `1213` indicates a deadlock. `6002` indicates a transaction rollback.

* **db-ps-mode**

   * Description: specifies whether to enable SQL precompilation. Valid values are `auto` and `disable`. The default value is `disable`.
   * Recommended value: `disable`.
   * If you set the value to `auto`, you must modify the `open_cursors` parameter. For example, you can run `alter system set open_cursors=65535;` to set `open_cursors` to `65535`.

* **skip_trx**

   * Description: specifies whether to skip transactions in a read-only test. The default value is `OFF`, which specifies not to skip transactions.
   * Recommended value: `ON` for read-only tests and `OFF` in other cases.

* **auto-inc**

   * Description: specifies whether values in the ID column automatically increment. The default value is `ON`.
   * Recommended value: `OFF` (in write scenarios).

* **warmup-time**

   * Description: the warm-up period in seconds. Statistics collection begins after the warm-up period elapses. Default value: `0`.
   * Recommended value: 10 to 30. You can specify a large value for a large dataset.

## Case study of Sysbench performance issues

### TPS decreases to 0 and errors are occasionally returned

#### Symptom

The following command runs the Sysbench benchmark on OceanBase Database Community Edition V4.1.0. The TPS decreases to 0 and an error is returned.

```shell
sysbench --db-driver=mysql --threads=500 --time=300000 --mysql-host=xxxxxxx --mysql-port=2883 --mysql-user='tpcc@t1' --mysql-password='******' --report-interval=2 --tables=100 /usr/share/sysbench/oltp_read_write.lua --db-ps-mode=disable run
```

The figure below shows the server configurations.

![image.png](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/EN_US/7.reference/1100.performance-test/server-configurations.png)

#### Cause analysis

The value of the `table_size` parameter is too small. The default value of `rand-type` is `special`. As a result, data is centralized and primary key conflicts occur. This causes a deadlock and the TPS decreases to 0.

1. Increase timeout periods for the test tenant.

   ```sql
   set global ob_query_timeout = 50000000000;
   set global ob_trx_timeout = 50000000000;
   ```

2. To reproduce the issue quickly, set `tables` to `1` and leave the values of other parameters unchanged.

   ```shell
    sysbench oltp_read_write.lua --mysql-host=[ip] --mysql-port=2881 --mysql-user=root@user --mysql-db=test --table_size=10000 --tables=1 --threads=500 --time=3600 --report-interval=1 --db-ps-mode=disable run
   ```

3. The TPS decreases to 0. However, the TPS and QPS sometimes can be greater than 0.

   ![image0.png](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/7.reference/3.performance-tuning-guide/6.performance-whitepaper/sysbench/%E6%9F%A5%E7%9C%8B%E5%86%85%E9%83%A8%E8%A1%A8-0.png)

4. Check the deadlock view.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_DEADLOCK_EVENT_HISTORY ORDER BY create_time DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

   ![image1.png](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/7.reference/3.performance-tuning-guide/6.performance-whitepaper/sysbench/%E6%9F%A5%E7%9C%8B%E5%86%85%E9%83%A8%E8%A1%A8-1.png)

   You can see the latest deadlock records. `role=victim` indicates that a transaction was terminated, and `role=witness` indicates that a transaction witnessed the conflict. `cycle_size=2` indicates that two transactions conflict with each other. `cycle_size>2` indicates that multiple transactions conflict with one transaction. Select an event whose `cycle_size` is `2`. Filter a group of conflicting transactions by `event_id`.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_DEADLOCK_EVENT_HISTORY WHERE cycle_size=2 ORDER BY create_time DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

   ![image2.png](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/7.reference/3.performance-tuning-guide/6.performance-whitepaper/sysbench/%E6%9F%A5%E7%9C%8B%E5%86%85%E9%83%A8%E8%A1%A8-2.png)

   You can view transaction IDs in the `VISITOR` field. You can find all SQL statements related to a transaction based on the transaction ID.

   ```sql
   SELECT TRACE_ID, TX_ID, QUERY_SQL FROM gv$ob_sql_audit WHERE TX_ID=5042912 ORDER BY REQUEST_TIME;
   SELECT TRACE_ID, TX_ID, QUERY_SQL FROM gv$ob_sql_audit WHERE TX_ID=5042591 ORDER BY REQUEST_TIME;
   ```

   ![image3.png](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/7.reference/3.performance-tuning-guide/6.performance-whitepaper/sysbench/%E6%9F%A5%E7%9C%8B%E5%86%85%E9%83%A8%E8%A1%A8-3.png)

   The figure shows that two transactions depend on each other as follows:

   * Update of Transaction 1: id=4978
   * Update of Transaction 2: id=5049
   * Update of Transaction 1: id=4978
   * Deletion of Transaction 2: id=5049

   After a deadlock occurs, Transaction 64317 is rolled back and Transaction 64235 is committed. This is because Transaction 64317 was created later than Transaction 64235. You can determine whether one transaction was created earlier or later than another one by comparing the `request_time` of their first SQL statements, which can be found in the `GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view.

   ```sql
   SELECT REQUEST_TIME, SVR_IP, SVR_PORT, SQL_EXEC_ID, TRACE_ID, TENANT_ID, TX_ID, SQL_ID, QUERY_SQL, PLAN_ID, PARTITION_CNT, IS_INNER_SQL, ELAPSED_TIME, EXECUTE_TIME, APPLICATION_WAIT_TIME FROM gv$ob_sql_audit WHERE TX_ID=64317 ORDER BY REQUEST_TIME;
   ```

   Query logs by trace ID. You can view a rolled back transaction. The error code is 6002, which indicates a rollback error. The abort reason is 4101, which indicates a deadlock.

   Find the SQL log that records a conflict of the terminated transaction. The error code in the last log is 4101. However, Sysbench does not return a deadlock error. Instead, it returns a rollback error (error code 6002).

   ```shell
   [2023-07-11 15:32:40.263794] INFO  [SERVER] send_error_packet (obmp_packet_sender.cpp:317) [28473][T1002_L0_G0][T1002][Y5B690B7C0505-00060030956354CB-0-0] [lt=14] sending error packet(err=-4101, extra_err_info=NULL, lbt()="0x1029cb40 0x832fadc 0x82e32f7 0x5b65d4f 0x5960718 0x595c58f 0x595a25a 0x8075f6c 0x595964c 0x80754ea 0x595665a 0x8075b24 0x1061b777 0x10613e9f 0x7f0215489e25 0x7f0214f48f1d")
   ```

   You can find the 6002 rollback error in the log corresponding to the last `begin` statement of the transaction. (Because the `commit` statement is not explicitly executed in the current transaction, the `begin` statement in the next transaction will cause the current transaction to be implicitly committed. Consequently, `begin` is the last SQL statement of the current transaction.) Sysbench does not handle the deadlock error. Instead, it returns the 6002 error.

   ```shell
   [2023-07-11 15:32:40.305922] INFO  [SERVER] send_error_packet (obmp_packet_sender.cpp:317) [28472][T1002_L0_G0][T1002][Y5B690B7C0505-0006003095136574-0-0] [lt=37] sending error packet(err=-6002, extra_err_info=NULL, lbt()="0x1029cb40 0x832fadc 0x82e32f7 0x5a55e57 0x5960c40 0x595c58f 0x595a25a 0x8075f6c 0x595964c 0x80754ea 0x595665a 0x8075b24 0x1061b777 0x10613e9f 0x7f0215489e25 0x7f0214f48f1d")
   ```

   If you cannot find the log, log throttling may have been enabled. We recommend that you increase the maximum bandwidth for system logs.

   ```sql
   alter system set syslog_io_bandwidth_limit='2G';
   ```

#### Conclusions and solutions

**Conclusions:**

1. If the default value `special` is used for `rand-type`, a deadlock may occur due to too many key conflicts. In such a scenario, Sysbench will exit.
2. If the default value `special` is used for `rand-type` and the values of `tables` and `table_size` are small, deadlocks occur frequently. Many transactions will be stuck and the test threads cannot promptly exit. As a result, the TPS will decrease to 0 for a few minutes and may occasionally be greater than 0.
3. A deadlocked transaction will be rolled back and an error will be returned. The returned error code may be 6002 rather than 1213.
4. If you specify a large value for `ob_query_timeout` and the deadlock detection feature does not take effect, transactions cannot be terminated and SQL statements are congested. In this case, the TPS stays at 0 for a long time and no error is returned.

**Solutions:**

1. Change the data distribution type. For example, you can set `--rand-type=uniform`.
2. If you do not want to change the data distribution type, you can increase the size of the dataset. For example, you can set `tables=100` and `table_size=1000000`.
3. If you do not want to change the data distribution type or the dataset size, you can try to ignore the specified errors. For example, you can set `--mysql-ignore-errors=1062,1213,6002`. However, this cannot avoid deadlocks.
