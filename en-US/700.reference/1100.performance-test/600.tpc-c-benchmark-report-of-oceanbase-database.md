# TPC-C benchmark report of OceanBase Database

## Test environment (Alibaba Cloud ECS)

* Three-node hardware configurations

    | Service type | ECS type | Number of instances | Number of CPU cores | Memory |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | OceanBase Database | ecs.g7.8xlarge | 3 | 32 | 128 GB <br>Each server has a system disk of 300 GB. Additionally, two cloud disks (400 GB) are mounted, one serving as the clog disk, and the other as the data disk. The performance level is PL1. |
    | OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) and BenchmarkSQL | ecs.c7.16xlarge | 1 | 64 | 128 GB |

* Three-node tenant specifications

   ```sql
   CREATE RESOURCE UNIT tpcc_unit max_cpu 26, memory_size '70g'
   CREATE RESOURCE POOL tpcc_pool unit = 'tpcc_unit', unit_num = 1, zone_list=('zone1','zone2','zone3');
   CREATE TENANT tpcc_tenant resource_pool_list=('tpcc_pool'),  zone_list('zone1', 'zone2', 'zone3'), primary_zone=RANDOM, locality='F@zone1,F@zone2,F@zone3' set variables ob_compatibility_mode='mysql', ob_tcp_invited_nodes='%';
   ```

* Software versions

   | Service type | Software version |
   | --- | --- |
   | OceanBase Database | <ul><li>Enterprise Edition: V4.2.1.0</li><li>Community Edition: V4.2.1.0_CE </li></ul> |
   | ODP | V4.2.0 |
   | BenchmarkSQL | BenchmarkSQL V5.0 |
   | Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) | mysql-connector-java-5.1.47 |
   | OS | CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core) |

## Test plan

1. Use OceanBase Deployer (OBD) to deploy an OceanBase cluster. Deploy ODP and the TPC-C tools on a separate server to avoid inadequate stress on the same server.

2. Deploy the cluster in the 1-1-1 architecture, where the cluster has three zones and each zone has one OBServer node. After successful deployment, create the tenant and users required for running the TPC-C benchmark. The sys tenant is a built-in system tenant for managing the cluster. Do not use the sys tenant to run the benchmark. Set `primary_zone` to `RANDOM` for the tenant.

3. For the detailed test steps, see [Run the TPC-C benchmark on OceanBase Database](../1100.performance-test/500.run-the-tpc-c-benchmark-on-oceanbase-database.md).

### Test specifications

```shell
warehouses=1000
loadWorkers=40
terminals = 800
runMins = 5
newOrderWeight = 45
paymentWeight = 43
orderStatusWeight = 4

```

## Results

Performance information of the OceanBase cluster in the 1-1-1 architecture is as follows:

```bash
[Thread-704] INFO   jTPCC : Term-00, Measured tpmC (NewOrders) = 289711.96
[Thread-704] INFO   jTPCC : Term-00, Measured tpmTOTAL = 644025.66
