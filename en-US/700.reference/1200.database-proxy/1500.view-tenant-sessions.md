# View tenant sessions

You can view sessions of a tenant by using views or SQL statements.

## Considerations

In this topic, OceanBase Database V4.3.0 and ODP V4.2.3 are used, and the `client_session_id_version = 2` and `proxy_id = 1` settings are specified for ODP. The return result varies for different versions and settings. For more information about how to view and set the parameters of ODP, see [View and modify parameters](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-odp-doc-en-10000000001177434).

## View sessions of a tenant by using a view

1. Log on to a MySQL or Oracle tenant of the cluster.

2. Execute the following statement to view tenant sessions.

   A tenant administrator can view all sessions of the tenant. A regular user can view only its own sessions. If you have the `PROCESS` privilege, you can view all sessions.

   * MySQL mode

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_PROCESSLIST;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

   The fields in the query results are described as follows:

   * `SVR_IP`: the IP address of the server to which the session belongs, which is the IP address of the OBServer node.

   * `SVR_PORT`: the RPC port number of the server to which the session belongs, which is the RPC port number of the OBServer node.

   * `SQL_PORT`: the SQL port number of the server to which the session belongs, which is the SQL port number of the OBServer node.

   * `ID`: the ID of the session.

   * `USER`: the user to which the session belongs.

   * `HOST`: the IP address and port number of the client that initiates the session.

     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>In this topic, OceanBase Database V4.3.0 and ODP V4.2.3 are used, and the <code>client_session_id_version = 2</code> and <code>proxy_id = 1</code> settings are specified for ODP. When you use OceanBase Database earlier than V4.3.0 or ODP earlier than V4.2.3, or you use ODP V4.2.3 but do not specify <code>client_session_id_version = 2</code> or <code>proxy_id = 1</code>, the meaning of this field varies depending on the database connection method. If you directly connect to the database, this field indicates the IP address and port number of the client that initiates the session. If you connect to the database by using ODP, this field indicates the IP address and port number of the ODP host. </p>
     </main>

   * `DB`: the name of the database to which the session is connected. In Oracle mode, the schema name that is the same as the username is displayed.

   * `TENANT`: the name of the tenant that is accessed in the session.

   * `COMMAND`: the type of the command being executed in the session.

   * `TIME`: the duration, in seconds, that the current command has been executed. If the command is retried, the system resets and recalculates the execution duration.

   * `TOTAL_TIME`: the total execution duration, in seconds, of the current command. If the command is retried, the system does not clear the total execution duration.

   * `STATE`: the status of the session.

   * `INFO`: the statements being executed in the session.

   * `PROXY_SESSID`: If the database is connected by using ODP, the value is the session ID on the ODP node. Otherwise, the value is `NULL`.

   * `MASTER_SESSID`: If the database is connected by using ODP, the value is the primary session ID on the ODP node, which is provided to associate the child sessions of the same SQL statement. Otherwise, the value is `NULL`.

   * `USER_CLIENT_IP`: the IP address of the client that initiates the session.

   * `USER_HOST`: the host name of the client that initiates the session.

   * `RETRY_CNT`: the number of retries of the current command.

   * `RETRY_INFO`: the retry information of the current command, which is usually the error code for the last retry.

   * `SQL_ID`: the SQL ID corresponding to the current command.

   * `TRANS_ID`: the ID of the transaction.

   * `THREAD_ID`: the ID of the thread. If the database is connected by using ODP, the value also indicates the session ID on the ODP node.

   * `SSL_CIPHER`: the name of the SSL cipher.

   * `TRACE_ID`: the trace ID.

   * `TRANS_STATE`: the status of the transaction.

   * `ACTION`: the name of the operation being executed that is set by calling the `DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_ACTION` procedure.

   * `MODULE`: the name of the module that is set by calling the `DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_MODULE` procedure.

   * `CLIENT_INFO`: the client information set by calling the `DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_CLIENT_INFO` procedure.

   * `LEVEL`: the monitoring level of end-to-end tracing for the session. For example, the value `1` indicates the diagnostics information at level `1`.

   * `SAMPLE_PERCENTAGE`: the sampling frequency of end-to-end tracing for the session. For example, the value `10` indicates that the diagnostics information is sampled at the frequency of 10%.

   * `RECORD_POLICY`: the recording strategy of end-to-end tracing for the session. Valid values:

      * `ALL`: All sampling-enabled traces that are hit are recorded in the log file immediately after each span ends.

      * `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY`: Among sampling-enabled traces that are hit, only traces of slow queries are recorded in the log file, and other traces are discarded.

         For this strategy, trace logs are recorded after a request ends and is determined as a slow query. In the proxy, the root span (transaction-level span) is immediately recorded when a slow query is detected.

      * `SAMPLE_AND_SLOW_QUERY`: Among sampling-enabled traces that are hit, those meeting any of the following conditions are recorded in the log file:

         1. The hidden parameter `_print_sample_ppm` is used for sampling at a frequency of 0.01% and the sampling result is hit.
         2. The condition specified in the `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY` strategy is met.

         In this mode, the logging time varies based on the situation. Specifically, if Condition 1 is met, it is marked on the client that the trace log will be forcibly recorded and this information will be transferred to subsequent components on the link. If Condition 2 is met, the logging time is the same as that in the `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY` strategy.

         For more information about end-to-end tracing, see [Overview](../../600.manage/900.daily-inspection/900.full-link-detection/100.full-link-diagnosis-overview.md).

   * `LB_VID`: the VPC ID of the load balancing service if you directly connect to the database in a public cloud. The value is always `NULL` in other scenarios.

   * `LB_VIP`: the IP address used by the client to connect to the load balancing service if you directly connect to the database in a public cloud. The value is always `NULL` in other scenarios.

   * `LB_VPORT`: the port used by the client to connect to the load balancing service if you directly connect to the database in a public cloud. The value is always `NULL` in other scenarios.

   * `IN_BYTES`: the inbound traffic of the session.

   * `OUT_BYTES`: the outbound traffic of the session.

## View tenant sessions by using the SHOW PROCESSLIST or SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST statement

You can execute the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` or `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST` statement to view tenant sessions.

The administrator of a tenant can view all sessions within the tenant. A regular user can view sessions of only the user. If you have the `PROCESS` privilege, you can view all sessions in all tenants. For more information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges (Oracle mode)](../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/600.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md) and [View user privileges (MySQL mode)](../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/400.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md). If you do not have the required privileges, contact the administrator to obtain the privileges. For more information, see [Modify user privileges (Oracle mode)](../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/700.modify-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md) and [Modify user privileges (MySQL mode)](../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/500.modify-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md).

1. Log on to a MySQL or Oracle tenant of the cluster.

2. Execute the following statement to view tenant sessions:

   * Use the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` statement

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>

If you connect to the database by using ODP, the statement returns the session information on the corresponding ODP node. If you directly connect to the database, the statement returns the session information on the corresponding OBServer node of the tenant. </p>
