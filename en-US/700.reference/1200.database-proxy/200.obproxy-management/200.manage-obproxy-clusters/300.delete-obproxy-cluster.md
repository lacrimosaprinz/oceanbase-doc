# Delete an ODP cluster

You can delete an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) cluster that is no longer required. After an ODP cluster is deleted, the ODPs in the cluster are uninstalled from all hosts, and the resources occupied by ODP services on the hosts are released.

## Prerequisites

* You have logged on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console and are assigned the `OBPROXY_MANAGER` role.

* The ODP cluster to be deleted no longer provides the proxy service.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the ODP cluster list, click the target ODP cluster. 

   The **Overview** page of the ODP cluster appears.

4. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the **More** icon, and select **Delete Cluster**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **Delete**.

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the progress.

   When the task status is **Completed**, and the **Clusters** list on the ODP page does not contain the ODP cluster, the cluster is deleted.
