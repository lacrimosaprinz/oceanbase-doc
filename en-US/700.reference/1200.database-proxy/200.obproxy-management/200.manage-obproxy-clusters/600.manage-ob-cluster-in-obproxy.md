# Manage OceanBase clusters connected to an ODP cluster

This topic describes how to connect an OceanBase cluster to an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP, also known as OBProxy) or delete an OceanBase cluster that is connected to an ODP cluster in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

## Add a connectable OceanBase cluster

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the ODP cluster list, click the target ODP cluster.

   The **Overview** page of the ODP cluster appears.

4. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Add Connectable OceanBase Cluster**.

5. In the dialog box that appears on the right, select a connectable OceanBase cluster.

   The proxyro user can access an OceanBase cluster only when its password for the OceanBase cluster is the same as that for the ODP cluster. If an OceanBase cluster cannot be connected by using the password of the proxyro user, you can use one of the following methods to solve the issue:

   * Change the password of the proxyro user for the ODP cluster. 
   <!-- * For more information, see [Change the password of the proxyro user](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-ocp-cn-10000000002099346). -->

   * Change the password of the proxyro user for the OceanBase cluster. 
   <!-- * For more information, see [User management under a MySQL tenant](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/enterprise-oceanbase-ocp-cn-10000000002100871). -->

6. Click **OK**.
