# Monitor ODP cluster performance

This topic describes how to view the performance monitoring data of an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP, also known as OBProxy) cluster in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), including the service monitoring information and system monitoring information.

## Service monitoring

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the ODP cluster list, click the ODP cluster whose performance data you want to view. Then, go to the **Service Monitoring** tab on the **Performance Monitoring** page.

   * On the **Service Monitoring** tab, you can select **Last 5 Minutes**, **Last 10 Minutes**, **Last 20 Minutes**, **Last 30 Minutes**, **Last 1 Hour**, **Last 3 Hours**, **Last 6 Hours**, or **Last 12 Hours**, or select **Custom Time** and specify a time range to view the corresponding monitoring data.

   * If you toggle on **Auto Refresh**, the system updates data once every 10 seconds.

4. You can view the performance monitoring data of the ODP cluster in the **Overview** section. Click **View All** in the upper-right corner to view information such as the transactions per second, requests per second, number of client connections, number of server connections, average response time for each SQL statement, average route table queries per second, and average number of bytes in a network request or response.

5. In the **Connected OceanBase Cluster Data** section, view the performance of interaction between the current ODP cluster and OceanBase clusters that use the ODP cluster.

   For each performance monitoring metric, you can view its maximum, minimum, and average values. You can click **Column Management** to select the metrics to display.

6. In the **OceanBase IP Address** section, view the performance of each ODP node in the current ODP cluster.

   For each performance monitoring metric, you can view its maximum, minimum, and average values. You can click **Column Management** to select the metrics to display.

## System monitoring

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the ODP cluster list, click the ODP cluster whose performance data you want to view. Then, go to the **System Monitoring** tab on the **Performance Monitoring** page.

   On the **System Monitoring** tab, you can select **Last 5 Minutes**, **Last 10 Minutes**, **Last 20 Minutes**, **Last 30 Minutes**, **Last 1 Hour**, **Last 3 Hours**, **Last 6 Hours**, or **Last 12 Hours**, or select **Custom Time** and specify a time range to view the corresponding monitoring data.

   You can also toggle on **Auto Refresh** to view data updated in real time.

4. In the **Overview** section, click **View All** in the upper-right corner to view information such as the Linux system load, CPU utilization, I/O usage, size of the I/O queue, average I/O requests per second, average time consumed per I/O request, average I/O data amount per second, network throughput, memory usage, and disk usage.
