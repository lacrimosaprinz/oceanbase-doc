# Stop an ODP

After you deploy an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP, also known as OBProxy), the obproxy process is started by default. You can run an SQL command to stop a single obproxy process.

## Stop the obproxy process

1. Log on as the admin user to the server on which the obproxy process runs.

2. Run the following command to view the ID of the obproxy process:

   ```shell
   $ps -ef|grep obproxy
   admin     37360      0  6 11:35 ?        00:00:09 bin/obproxy
   admin     43055  36750  0 11:37 pts/10   00:00:00 grep --color=auto obproxy
   root      85623      1  0 Jun02 ?        00:15:19 /home/admin/ocp_agent/obagent/obstat2 -o http://xx.xx.xx.xx:81 -c test323 __obproxy__ -f 20
   ```

   The ID of the obproxy process is 37360.

3. Run the following command to stop the obproxy process based on the process ID:

   ```shell
   $kill -9 37360
   ```

4. Run the following command to confirm whether the obproxy process exists:

   ```shell
   $ps -ef|grep obproxy
   admin     45795  36750  0 11:39 pts/10   00:00:00 grep --color=auto obproxy
   root      85623      1  0 Jun02 ?        00:15:19 /home/admin/ocp_agent/obagent/obstat2 -o http://xx.xx.xx.xx:81 -c test323 __obproxy__ -f 20
   ```
