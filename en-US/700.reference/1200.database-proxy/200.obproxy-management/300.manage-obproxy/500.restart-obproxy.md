# Restart an ODP

This topic describes how to restart an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP).

## Restart a single ODP by using commands

When an exception occurs in an ODP, you can run commands to restart the obproxy process.

To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Log on as the admin user to the server that hosts the ODP to be restarted.

2. Stop the obproxy process.

   For more information, see [Stop an ODP](../300.manage-obproxy/400.stop-obproxy.md).

3. Start the obproxy process.

   For more information, see [Start an ODP](../300.manage-obproxy/200.start-obproxy.md).
