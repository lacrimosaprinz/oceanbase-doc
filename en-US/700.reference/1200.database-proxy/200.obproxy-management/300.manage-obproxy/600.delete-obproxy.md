# Delete an ODP

This topic describes how to delete an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP, also known as OBProxy) that is no longer needed from the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. You can delete one or more ODPs based on your business requirements.

## Prerequisites

No service is running on the ODP.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the ODP cluster list, click the target ODP cluster.

   The **Overview** page of the ODP cluster appears.

4. Perform the following operations:

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p><ul>
   <li>If the deleted ODP is the last ODP in the ODP cluster, applications cannot connect to the corresponding database. Proceed with caution. </li>
   <li>After an ODP is deleted, it will be removed from the load balancing strategy configuration and the corresponding application will be affected. </li>
   </ul></p>
   </main>

   * In the **OBProxies** section, find the ODP that you want to delete, click the More icon in the **Actions** column, and then select **Delete**. In the dialog box that appears, click **Delete**.

   * To delete multiple ODPs at a time, select the ODPs that you want to delete in the **OBProxies** list, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner, and then select **Batch Delete**. In the dialog box that appears, click **Delete**.

5. In the dialog box that appears, click **Delete**.

   In the dialog box, you can click **View Task** to view the progress of the deletion task.

   When the task status is **Completed**, and the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page of the cluster does not contain the ODP, the ODP is deleted.
