# Upgrade one or more ODPs

If a new OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP, also known as OBProxy) version is available, you can upgrade one or more ODPs in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

## Prerequisites

You have logged on to the OCP console and are granted permissions on the target ODP.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the ODP cluster list, click the target ODP cluster.

   The **Overview** page of the ODP cluster appears.

4. Perform the following operations:

   * In the **OBProxies** section, find the ODP that you want to upgrade and click **Upgrade** in the **Actions** column. In the dialog box that appears, select or upload a package of the new version and then click **OK**.

   * In the **OBProxies** section, select the ODPs that you want to upgrade and click **Batch Upgrade** in the upper-right corner of the list. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You can upgrade an ODP only to a higher version. The hardware architecture of the target version must match that of the current host. </p>
   </main>

6. Click **OK**.

   In the dialog box that appears, you can click **View Task** to view the progress.

   When the task status is **Completed**, and the ODP in the **OBProxies** list on the **Overview** page is in the **Running** state, the upgrade succeeds.
