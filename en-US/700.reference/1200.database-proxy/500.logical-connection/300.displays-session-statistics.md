# Query the metrics of a session

This topic describes how to query the internal metrics, such as the number of SQL request responses and size of an SQL request response, of a specified session on OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP).

## Procedure

You can use the `SHOW PROXYSESSION STAT` statement in the sys tenant or a user tenant to query the internal metrics of a specified client session on ODP.

1. Connect to OceanBase Database by using ODP.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -uusername@obtenant#obdemo -P2883 -p****** -c -A oceanbase
   ```

   For more information about how to connect to OceanBase Database by using ODP, see [Connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using OBClient](../../../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/300.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md) and [Connect to an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database by using OBClient](../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-oracle-mode/200.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-oracle-mode.md).

2. Query the internal metrics of the specified client session on ODP.

   ```sql
   SHOW PROXYSESSION STAT id LIKE 'xx';
   ```

   The parameters are described as follows:

   * In the statement, `id` can be replaced with `cs_id` or `connection_id`. These parameters are equivalent

      `cs_id` indicates the ID of a client session in ODP. `connection_id` indicates the ID of a client session in OceanBase Database.

      You can obtain the `connection_id` value by using the `SELECT CONNECTION_ID();` statement in MySQL mode and the `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST;` statement in Oracle mode.

   * The `LIKE` option supports fuzzy matches. Percent signs (%) and underscores (_) are supported.

   Here is an example:

   :::tab
   tab MySQL mode

   1. Query `cs_id` or `connection_id`.

      Execute the following statement to query `cs_id`:

      ```sql
      SHOW PROXYSESSION;
      ```

      In the following query result,`Id` is equivalent to `cs_id`.

      ```shell
      +----------------------+-------+----------+----------+------+----------------------+------+-------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------+-------+-----------+
      | proxy_sessid         | Id    | Cluster  | Tenant   | User | Host                 | db   | trans_count | svr_session_count | state             | tid   | pid   | using_ssl |

      +----------------------+-------+----------+----------+------+----------------------+------+-------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------+-------+-----------+
      1 row in set
      ```

      Execute the following statement to query `connection_id`:

      ```sql
      SELECT CONNECTION_ID();
      ```

      The result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-----------------+
      | CONNECTION_ID() |
      +-----------------+
      |      3221597019 |
      +-----------------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   2. Query the internal metrics.

      ```sql
      SHOW PROXYSESSION STAT 11 LIKE '%time%';
      ```

      or

      ```sql
      SHOW PROXYSESSION STAT 3221597019 LIKE '%time%';
