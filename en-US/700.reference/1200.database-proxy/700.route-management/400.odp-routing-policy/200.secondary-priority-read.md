# Follower-first read

You can specify the user-level session variable `proxy_route_policy` to make the OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) first read data from a follower. This setting takes effect in weak consistency read mode. When the setting is in effect, data is first read from a follower instead of a replica selected by the load balancer. To enable follower-first read, perform the following steps:

Log on to the business tenant from a supported client tool. Execute the following statement to set the `proxy_route_policy` variable:

```sql
obclient> SET @proxy_route_policy='[policy]';
```

Valid values of the `[policy]` parameter:

1. `follower_first`: ODP reads data first from a follower, even if the cluster is in a major compaction. The priority order is as follows:

   Follower not in a major compaction in the same IDC \> Follower not in a major compaction in a different IDC in the same region \> Follower in a major compaction in the same IDC \> Follower in a major compaction in a different IDC in the same region \> Leader not in a major compaction in the same IDC \> Leader not in a major compaction in a different IDC in the same region \> Follower not in a major compaction in a different region \> Follower in a major compaction in a different region \> Leader not in a major compaction in a different region \> Leader in a major compaction in a different region

2. `unmerge_follower_first`: ODP reads data first from a follower that is not in a major compaction. The priority order is as follows:

   Follower not in a major compaction in the same IDC \> Follower not in a major compaction in a different IDC in the same region \> Leader not in a major compaction in the same IDC \> Leader not in a major compaction in a different IDC in the same region \> Follower in a major compaction in the same IDC \> Follower in a major compaction in a different IDC in the same region \> Follower not in a major compaction in a different region \> Leader not in a major compaction in a different region \> Follower in a major compaction in a different region \> Leader in a major compaction in a different region

3. Other values: The normal load-balanced routing logic in weak consistency read mode is adopted. The priority order is as follows:

   Leader or follower not in a major compaction in the same IDC \> Leader or follower not in a major compaction in a different IDC in the same region \> Leader or follower in a major compaction in the same IDC \> Leader or follower in a major compaction in a different IDC in the same region --\> Leader or follower not in a major compaction in a different region \> Leader or follower in a major compaction in a different region
