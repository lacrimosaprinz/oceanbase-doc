# OBCI

OceanBase Call Interface (OBCI) is a C language tool for interface calls in OceanBase Database. It provides features that are fully compatible with Oracle Call Interface (OCI).

OCI is an application development tool and an API provided by Oracle. You can use it to access Oracle database servers to control the execution of various SQL statements and create applications. OCI supports all SQL data definition, data manipulation, query, and transaction management operations. It also supports the data types, call methods, syntax, and semantics of C and C++. OCI provides a set of interface subroutines, also known as functions, that have access to Oracle databases.  OBCI is an Oracle-compatible interface that is developed based on interface standards of OCI considering features of OceanBase Database.

## Features

OBCI allows you to use the C language to manipulate data in OceanBase Database. It provides standard database access functions and indexes in the form of dynamic-link libraries (the OCI libraries). Applications can use these functions by connecting to these libraries. OBCI provides the following main features:

* Supports the development of scalable and multi-threaded applications.

* Supports SQL access functions that enable you to manage database access, process SQL statements, and manipulate objects retrieved from OceanBase Database servers.

* Supports data type mapping and manipulation functions that allow you to manipulate OceanBase data type attributes.
