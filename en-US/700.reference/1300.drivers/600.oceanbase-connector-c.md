# OceanBase Connector/C

OceanBase Connector/C is an OBClient development component based on C/C++. OceanBase Connector/C supports C API libraries.

OceanBase Connector/C allows C/C++ applications to access distributed OceanBase clusters from the underlying layer. Then, the applications can perform operations such as database connection, data access, error processing, and prepared statement processing.

Also known as `LibobClient`, OceanBase Connector/C allows an application to run as an independent server process to communicate with OBServer nodes by using network connections. A client application references the C API header file during compilation and can connect to the C API library file.
