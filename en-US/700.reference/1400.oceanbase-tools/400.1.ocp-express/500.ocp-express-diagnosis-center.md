# Diagnostic analysis

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Express allows you to manage tenant sessions, top SQL statements, and slow SQL statements. For example, you can close a session or perform SQL throttling.

## Session diagnostics

The **Session** page displays session diagnostics of different tenants in two tabs: **Tenant Session** and **Session Statistics**.

* The **Tenant Session** tab displays information about all sessions of the current tenant in the following columns: Session ID, SQL, User, Source, Database Name, Command, Execution Time (s), Status, and OBProxy.

   * You can select **View Active Sessions Only** in the upper-right corner to view information about only active sessions.
   * You can view the SQL statement of a session, close the session, and close the current query.

* The **Session Statistics**displays the statistics of all sessions of the tenant.

   You can view the overall session statistics, such as the total number of sessions, number of active sessions, and maximum duration of active sessions. You can view the number of active sessions and total number of sessions by user, access source, and database.

## SQL diagnostics

SQL issues are the most frequently seen performance issues. OCP Express classifies SQL statements into suspicious SQL statements and top SQL statements based on their characteristics. When an exception occurs during the execution of an SQL statement, you can select a diagnostic type based on the scenario to locate the exception.

You can filter top SQL statements and slow SQL statements by time range, OBServer node, internal SQL, or keyword, or specify advanced search conditions in Conditions to filter the SQL statements. The **Set Throttling** and **Column Management** buttons are provided for you to view information about abnormal SQL statements and optimize SQL statements online.

* **TopSQL**: displays the SQL statements in descending order of the total response time in the tenant. You can analyze these SQL statements to identify abnormal requests or optimize specific SQL statements.

* **SlowSQL**: displays the SQL statements whose execution time exceeds the specified threshold, which is 100 ms by default. You can use the slow SQL diagnostics feature to identify risky statements and avoid risks.
