# Log service

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Express provides the log query feature. The log query feature allows you to view the logs of OBServer nodes and OCP-Agent by time range, log type, log level, node IP address, and keyword.

You can view the error logs and component monitoring information to identify the specific abnormal component, and then check the related logs to analyze the issue.
