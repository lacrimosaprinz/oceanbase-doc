# View cluster overview information

After you log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console, the **Cluster Overview** page automatically appears. To view the overview data of a cluster, you must have the management permission or read-only permission on the cluster.

The **Cluster Overview** page displays information about the current cluster in the following fields: **Cluster**, **OBServer**, **Tenant**, **Tenant Compaction Time Top3**, **Tenant SlowSQL Top3**, **Tenant Resource Usage Top3**, and **Cluster Topo**. You can also view the distribution of resource units and manage parameters on the **Cluster Overview** page.

## Cluster

The **Cluster** section displays the running status, CPU utilization, disk usage, and memory usage of the cluster. You can move the pointer over the **More** icon in the upper-right corner to view the name and deployment mode of the cluster.

## OBServer

In the **OBServer** section, you can view the running status of OBServer nodes in the cluster. In this way, you can perform O&M operations on abnormal OBServer nodes. You can click the number next to the Running state to view details about the OBServer nodes.

## Tenant Compaction Time Top3

The **Tenant Compaction Time Top3** section displays information about the top 3 tenants sorted by the last major compaction time in a line chart. A major compaction merges all dynamic and static data, which is time-consuming. When the incremental data generated through minor compactions reaches the specified threshold, a major compaction of data is performed to obtain a major version.

The meanings of colors in the line chart are described as follows:

* Green: indicates that the time taken by the last two major compactions decreases.
* Red: indicates that the time taken in the last two major compactions increases.

## Tenant SlowSQL Top3

The **Tenant SlowSQL Top3** section displays information about the top 3 tenants with the most slow SQL statements within the last six hours in a line chart.

## Tenant Resource Usage Top3

The Tenant Resource Usage Top3 section displays information about the top 3 tenants with the highest CPU utilization, memory usage, and data amount.

## Cluster Topo

In the **Cluster Topo** section, you can view the names, region, IDC, number of OBServer nodes, RootServer, and status of zones of the cluster.
You can click the **+** button prior to the name of a zone to view details about OBServer nodes in this zone, including the IP address, SQL port, RPC port, hardware architecture, resource usage, and status.

You can click the buttons in the upper-right corner to display the information in the list or topology style.
