# Tenant management

A tenant is a logical concept that represents a resource allocation unit in OceanBase Database. It is the basis for the management of database objects and resources. It is critical for system O&M, especially for the O&M of cloud databases. Log on to OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Express. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenant Management** to go to the tenant list page. By default, the information about tenants that you have the privilege to view is displayed.

## Tenant list

The **Tenants** section displays information about tenants in the following fields: **Tenant Name, Tenant Mode, Connection String, Read-only, Locked, Status, Created At,** and **Actions**. You can query tenants by name in batches, and the tenant names are separated with spaces.

* You can click the name of a tenant to go to the Tenant Overview page.

* You can click **Copy** in the **Connection String** column of a tenant to copy the connection string.

* You can perform tenant management operations, such as creating a tenant, locking a tenant, and copying a tenant.
