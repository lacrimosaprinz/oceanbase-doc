# Overview

OceanBase Shell (OBShell) is an out-of-the-box command-line tool designed for O&M engineers and developers to manage local OceanBase clusters. It supports cluster O&M and provides O&M and management APIs based on OBServer nodes, enabling seamless integration of various third-party ecosystem tools with OceanBase Database to centrally manage a single OceanBase cluster. This effectively reduces the complexity and costs associated with OceanBase cluster management.

Additionally, OBShell does not require any additional installation. After installing OceanBase-CE by any method, you will find the OBShell executable file in the `bin` directory of the working directory on any node.
