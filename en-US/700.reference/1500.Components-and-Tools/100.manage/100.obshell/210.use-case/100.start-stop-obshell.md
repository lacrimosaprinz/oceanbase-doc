# Start or stop OBShell

## Start OBShell

You can start OceanBase Shell (OBShell) by running the following command:

```shell
${home_path}/bin/obshell agent start [--ip] [-P] [--takeover]
```

Here is an example:

```obshell
[admin@test001 ~]$ /home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell agent start --ip 10.10.10.1 -P 2886
```

Here, `home_path` is the installation directory for OceanBase Database. By default, OBShell is located in the `bin` directory within the OceanBase Database installation directory.

The following table describes the options in the command.

|---- | ----- | ------ | ----- | -----|
| --ip | No | string | N/A | The IP address of OBShell. |
|  -P/--port | No | int | 2886 | The port number of OBShell. |
