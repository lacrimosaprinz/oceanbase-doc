# Overview

OceanBase Shell (OBShell) is an out-of-the-box command-line tool for O&M engineers and developers to manage local OceanBase clusters. OBShell supports cluster O&M and provides O&M and management APIs based on OBServer nodes. This allows you to connect different third-party ecosystem tools to OceanBase Database to manage a single OceanBase cluster, which reduces the difficulty in and costs of OceanBase cluster management.
