## Features of ob-operator

* OceanBase cluster deployment. For more information, see [Create a cluster](500.ob-operator-user-guide/100.cluster-management-of-ob-operator/100.create-cluster-of-ob-operator.md).

* OceanBase cluster upgrade. For more information, see [Upgrade a cluster](500.ob-operator-user-guide/100.cluster-management-of-ob-operator/500.upgrade-cluster-of-ob-operator.md).

* OceanBase cluster scaling. For more information about how to scale out an OceanBase cluster, see [Scale out a cluster](500.ob-operator-user-guide/100.cluster-management-of-ob-operator/200.cluster-scale-out-of-ob-operator/100.adding-a-zone-to-a-cluster-of-ob-operator.md). For more information about how to scale in an OceanBase cluster, see [Scale in a cluster](500.ob-operator-user-guide/100.cluster-management-of-ob-operator/300.cluster-scale-in-of-ob-operator/100.reduce-zone-from-cluster-of-ob-operator.md).

* OceanBase cluster monitoring. For more information, see the content about monitoring in [Create a cluster](500.ob-operator-user-guide/100.cluster-management-of-ob-operator/100.create-cluster-of-ob-operator.md).

* Tenant management. For more information, see [Tenant management](500.ob-operator-user-guide/200.tenant-management-of-ob-operator/100.create-tenant-of-ob-operator.md).

* Backup and restore. For more information, see [Backup and restore](500.ob-operator-user-guide/300.backup-recovery-of-ob-operator/100.cluster-backup-of-ob-operator.md).

* Automatic fault recovery. ob-operator provides the automatic fault recovery feature, which can automatically recover a cluster when the cluster fails and the majority of replicas are still available, thereby ensuring the normal operation of the cluster.
