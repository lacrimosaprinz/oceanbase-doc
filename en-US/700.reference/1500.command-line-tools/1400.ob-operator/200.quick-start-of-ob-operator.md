# Quick start

This topic describes how to deploy ob-operator, deploy an OceanBase demo environment, create a test tenant, delete an OceanBase cluster, and delete ob-operator.

## Prerequisites

You have prepared a Kubernetes cluster, and labeled at least one node `ob.zone=test`. The node has at least two CPU cores, 10 GB of memory, and 100 GB of storage space.

You can run the `kubectl label node <node_name> ob.zone=test` command to label nodes.

## Deploy ob-operator

### Deploy CRDs

Run the following command to deploy custom resource definitions (CRDs):

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/crd.yaml
```

Run the following command to view the CRDs:

```shell
kubectl get crds
```

The following output indicates that the CRDs are deployed.

```shell
backups.cloud.oceanbase.com             2023-06-16T11:02:15Z
obclusters.cloud.oceanbase.com          2023-06-16T11:02:15Z

```

### Deploy ob-operator

Run the following command to deploy ob-operator:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/operator.yaml
```

Run the following command to check whether ob-operator is deployed:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n oceanbase-system
```

The returned result is as follows:

```shell
NAME                                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ob-operator-controller-manager-78587645d-w7vbk   2/2     Running   0          18d
```

If `READY:2/2,STATUS:Running` is displayed, ob-operator is deployed successfully.

## Deploy an OceanBase cluster

### Create a test cluster

Run the following command to create a test cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/obcluster_mini.yaml
```

### View the cluster deployment status

Run the following command to check whether the created cluster is deployed:

```shell
kubectl get obcluster ob-test -o yaml
```

If the status in the returned result is `Ready`, the cluster is deployed.

```shell
status:
  status: Ready
  topology:
  - cluster: cn
    clusterStatus: Ready
    lastTransitionTime: "2023-07-12T08:46:16Z"
    zone:
    - availableReplicas: 1
      expectedReplicas: 1
      name: zone1
      region: region1
      zoneStatus: Ready
    - availableReplicas: 1
      expectedReplicas: 1
      name: zone2
      region: region1
      zoneStatus: Ready
    - availableReplicas: 1
      expectedReplicas: 1
      name: zone3
      region: region1
      zoneStatus: Ready
```

### Test the connection to the cluster

Run the following command to obtain the endpoint of the cluster:

```shell
kubectl get svc svc-ob-test
```

The returned result is as follows:

```shell
NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP        EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
svc-ob-test   ClusterIP   xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx   <none>        2881/TCP   41h
```

Use mysql to connect to the cluster.

```shell
mysql -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -uroot oceanbase -A -c
```

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The OceanBase cluster service is of the ClusterIP type, and you must establish a connection to the cluster from a Kubernetes node. If you want to remotely connect to the cluster, you must configure <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster/">port forwarding</a>. </p>
</main>

## Create a tenant

### Create a test tenant

Run the following command to create a test tenant:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/obtenant_mini.yaml
```

### View the tenant status

Run the following command to check whether the tenant is created:

```shell
kubectl get tenant obtenant -o yaml
```

If the `status` field in the `status` section is `Running` in the returned result, the tenant is deployed.

```shell
status:
  connectWhiteList: '%'
  status: Running
  topology:
  - priority: 2
    resource:
      logDiskSize: "3221225472"
      maxCPU: 2500m
      maxDiskSize: "0"
      maxIops: 1024
      memorySize: "1073741824"
      minCPU: "1"
      minIops: 1024
    type:
      name: FULL
      replica: 1
    unitNum: 1
    units:
    - migrate:
        serverIP: ""
        serverPort: 0
      serverIP: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
      serverPort: 2882
      status: ACTIVE
      unitId: 1001
    zone: zone1
```

### Connect to the tenant

After the tenant is created, run the following command to connect to the tenant:

```shell
mysql -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -uroot@obtenant oceanbase -A -c
```

For more information, see [Create a tenant](500.ob-operator-user-guide/200.tenant-management-of-ob-operator/100.create-tenant-of-ob-operator.md).

## Delete an OceanBase cluster

Run the following command to delete an OceanBase cluster:

```shell
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/obcluster_mini.yaml
```

Run the following command to check whether the cluster is deleted:

```shell
kubectl get obcluster
```

The following result is returned. If no OceanBase cluster resources are found, the cluster is deleted.

```shell
No resources found in default namespace.
```

For more information, see [Delete a cluster](500.ob-operator-user-guide/100.cluster-management-of-ob-operator/400.delete-cluster-of-ob-operator.md).
