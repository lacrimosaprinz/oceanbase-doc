# Deploy ob-operator

ob-operator simplifies the deployment and management of OceanBase clusters in Kubernetes. You can use either of the following methods to deploy ob-operator:

## Use Helm to deploy ob-operator

Before you use Helm commands to deploy ob-operator, you must install Helm. After Helm is installed, run the following command to deploy ob-operator:

```shell
helm repo add ob-operator https://oceanbase.github.io/ob-operator/
helm install ob-operator ob-operator/ob-operator --namespace=oceanbase-system --create-namespace  --version=1.2.0
```

where

* `namespace` specifies the namespace, which can be customized.

* `version` specifies the version of ob-operator. The current version is V1.2.0.

## Use configuration files to deploy ob-operator

You can deploy ob-operator by using configuration files in either of the following ways:

* Use the default configuration files:
  You can run the following commands to directly use the configuration files on GitHub for deployment:

   ```shell
   # deploy CRD
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/crd.yaml

   # deploy ob-operator
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/operator.yaml
   ```

* Use custom configuration files: 
  You can download the configuration files from GitHub, modify the files as needed, and then deploy ob-operator by using the modified files.  
  
   1. Download the configuration files.

      ```shell
      # download the config file
      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/crd.yaml
      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/master/deploy/operator.yaml
      ```

   2. Modify the configuration files as needed, and then run the following commands to deploy ob-operator:

      ```shell
      # after making some modification
      kubectl apply -f crd.yaml
      kubectl apply -f operator.yaml
      ```

## View the deployment result

Run the following command to view the CRDs:

```shell
kubectl get crds
```

The following output indicates that the CRDs are deployed.

```shell
backups.cloud.oceanbase.com             2023-06-16T11:02:15Z
obclusters.cloud.oceanbase.com          2023-06-16T11:02:15Z

tenants.cloud.oceanbase.com             2023-06-16T11:02:15Z
```

Run the following command to check whether ob-operator is deployed:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n oceanbase-system
```

The following result is returned. If all the containers are ready and in the running state, ob-operator is deployed.

```shell
NAME                                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ob-operator-controller-manager-78587645d-w7vbk   2/2     Running   0          18d
```
