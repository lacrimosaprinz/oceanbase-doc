# Add zones to a cluster

This topic describes how to scale out a cluster by adding zones to the cluster.

You can modify the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file of the OceanBase cluster to add zones.

The `spec.topology.cluster[index1].zone` attribute in the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file specifies the distribution of zones in the OceanBase cluster deployed in the `cluster[index1]` Kubernetes cluster. You can add zones to the OceanBase cluster by modifying the value of this attribute.

## Prerequisites

Before you add zones to the OceanBase cluster, make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

* The server has sufficient resources for the new zones.

* ob-operator determines the distribution of OBServer nodes based on the setting of `nodeSelector` in the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file of OceanBase Database. Therefore, you must first configure labels for Kubernetes nodes. For more information, see [Create a cluster](../100.create-cluster-of-ob-operator.md).

## Procedure

Assume that the current cluster has three zones, `zone1`, `zone2`, and `zone3`, each zone contains one OBServer node, and you want to scale out the cluster to five zones.

1. Modify the `obcluster.yaml` file to add `zone4` and `zone5`.

    ```yaml
    # For example, the OceanBase cluster has three zones.
    spec:
      topology:
        - cluster: cn
          zone:
          - name: zone1
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone1
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone2
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone2
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone3
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone3
            replicas: 1


    # Add zone4 and zone5 to the cluster.
    spec:
      topology:
        - cluster: cn
          zone:
          - name: zone1
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone1
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone2
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone2
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone3
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone3
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone4 # Newly added zone
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone4
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone5 # Newly added zone
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone5
            replicas: 1
    ```

2. Run the following command for the modification to take effect:

    ```yaml
    kubectl apply -f obcluster.yaml
    ```

3. Run the following command to check whether the modification has taken effect:

    ```yaml
    kubectl get pods -n obcluster
    ```

   Here is an example of the command output:

    ```yaml
    NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone1-0   2/2     Running   0          8m9s
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone2-0   2/2     Running   0          8m9s
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone3-0   2/2     Running   0          8m9s
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone4-0   2/2     Running   0          8m9s
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone5-0   2/2     Running   0          8m9s
    ```

    If the values of `READY` are both `2/2` and the values of `STATUS` are both `Running` for the pods corresponding to `zone4` and `zone5`, `zone4` and `zone5` are added to the cluster.
