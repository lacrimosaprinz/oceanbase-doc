# Add OBServer nodes to zones

This topic describes how to scale out a cluster by adding OBServer nodes to zones in the cluster.

You can modify the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file of the OceanBase cluster to add OBServer nodes to zones.

The `spec.topology.cluster[index1].zone[index2].replicas` attribute in the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file specifies the number of OBServer nodes in the `[index2]` zone of the OceanBase cluster deployed in the `[index1]` Kubernetes cluster. You can modify the value of this attribute to add OBServer nodes to a zone.

## Prerequisites

Before you add an OBServer node to a zone, make sure that the server has sufficient resources for the new OBServer node.

## Procedure

Assume that the current cluster has three zones, `zone1`, `zone2`, and `zone3`, each zone contains one OBServer node, and you want to add one OBServer node to each zone so that each zone contains two OBServer nodes.

1. Modify the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file and change the value of `replicas` from `1` to `2` for each zone.

    ```yaml
    # For example, each zone has one OBServer node.
    spec:
      topology:
        - cluster: cn
          zone:
          - name: zone1
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone1
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone2
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone2
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone3
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone3
            replicas: 1

    # Add an OBServer node to each zone.
    spec:
      topology:
        - cluster: cn
          zone:
          - name: zone1
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone1
            replicas: 2 # 1 -> 2
          - name: zone2
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone2
            replicas: 2 # 1 -> 2
          - name: zone3
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone3
            replicas: 2 # 1 -> 2
    ```

2. You can modify the number of OBServer nodes for multiple zones at a time. Run the following command for the modification to take effect:

    ```yaml
    kubectl apply -f obcluster.yaml
    ```

3. Run the following command to check whether the modification has taken effect:

    ```yaml
    kubectl get pod -n obcluster
    ```

    Here is an example of the command output:

    ```yaml
    NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone1-0   2/2     Running   0          84m
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone3-0   2/2     Running   0          84m
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone2-0   2/2     Running   0          84m
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone1-1   2/2     Running   0          3m40s
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone2-1   2/2     Running   0          3m40s
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone3-1   2/2     Running   0          3m39s
    ```

    The preceding result shows that `zone1`, `zone2`, and `zone3` each have two pods respectively corresponding to two OBServer nodes, the values of `READY` are all `2/2`, and the values of `STATUS` are all `Running`, indicating that the scale-out is successful.
