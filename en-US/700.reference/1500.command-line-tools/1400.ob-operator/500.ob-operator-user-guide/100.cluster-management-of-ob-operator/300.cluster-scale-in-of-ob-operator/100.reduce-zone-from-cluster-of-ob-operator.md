# Delete zones from a cluster

This topic describes how to scale in a cluster by deleting zones from the cluster.

You can modify the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file of the OceanBase cluster to delete zones from the cluster.

The `spec.topology.cluster[index1].zone` attribute in the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file specifies the distribution of zones of the OceanBase cluster deployed in the `[index1]` Kubernetes cluster. You can modify the value of this attribute to delete zones from the cluster.

## Procedure

Assume that the current cluster has five zones, `zone1`, `zone2`, `zone3`, `zone4`, and `zone5`, each zone contains one OBServer node, and you want to reduce the number of zones of the cluster to three.

1. Modify the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file to delete `zone4` and `zone5`.

    ```yaml
    # For example, the OceanBase cluster has five zones.
    spec:
      topology:
        - cluster: cn
          zone:
          - name: zone1
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone1
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone2
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone2
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone3
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone3
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone4
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone3
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone5
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone3
            replicas: 1


    # Delete zone4 and zone5 from the cluster.
    spec:
      topology:
        - cluster: cn
          zone:
          - name: zone1
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone1
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone2
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone2
            replicas: 1
          - name: zone3
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone3
            replicas: 1

    ```

2. Run the following command for the modification to take effect:

    ```yaml
    kubectl apply -f obcluster.yaml
    ```

3. Run the following command to check whether the modification has taken effect:

    ```yaml
    kubectl get pods -n obcluster
    ```

   Here is an example of the command output:

    ```yaml
    NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone1-0   2/2     Running   0          8m9s
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone2-0   2/2     Running   0          8m9s
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone3-0   2/2     Running   0          8m9s
    ```

   The preceding result shows that the cluster has only three zones, `zone1`, `zone2`, and `zone3`. `zone4` and `zone5` have been deleted.
