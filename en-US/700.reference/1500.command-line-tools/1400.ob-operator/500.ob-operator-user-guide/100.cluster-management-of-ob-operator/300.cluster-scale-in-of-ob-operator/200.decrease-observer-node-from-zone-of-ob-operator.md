# Delete OBServer nodes from zones

This topic describes how to scale in an OceanBase cluster by deleting OBServer nodes from zones.

Make sure that the zones still have sufficient resources to bear the load of the tenant after you delete the OBServer nodes.

You can modify the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file of the OceanBase cluster to delete OBServer nodes from zones. Generally, you must delete the same number of OBServer nodes from each zone.

The `spec.topology.cluster[index1].zone[index2].replicas` attribute in the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file specifies the number of OBServer nodes in the `[index2]` zone of the OceanBase cluster deployed in the `[index1]` Kubernetes cluster. You can modify the value of this attribute to delete OBServer nodes from a zone.

## Procedure

Assume that the current cluster has three zones, `zone1`, `zone2`, and `zone3`, each zone contains two OBServer nodes, and you want to delete one OBServer node from each zone for scale-in. After the scale-in, each of the three zones has only one OBServer node.

1. Modify the `obcluster.yaml` configuration file to change the value of `replicas` from `2` to `1` for each zone.

    ```yaml
    # For example, each zone has two OBServer nodes.
    spec:
      topology:
        - cluster: cn
          zone:
          - name: zone1
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone1
            replicas: 2
          - name: zone2
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone2
            replicas: 2
          - name: zone3
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone3
            replicas: 2

    # Reduce the number of OBServer nodes in each zone to 1.
    spec:
      topology:
        - cluster: cn
          zone:
          - name: zone1
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone1
            replicas: 1 # 2 -> 1
          - name: zone2
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone2
            replicas: 1 # 2 -> 1
          - name: zone3
            region: region1
            nodeSelector:
              ob.zone: zone3
            replicas: 1 # 2 -> 1
    ```

2. Run the following command for the modification to take effect:

    ```yaml
    kubectl apply -f obcluster.yaml
    ```

3. Run the following command to check whether the modification has taken effect:

    ```yaml
    kubectl get pod -n obcluster
    ```

    Here is an example of the command output:

    ```yaml
    NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone1-0   2/2     Running   0          84m
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone3-0   2/2     Running   0          84m
    sapp-ob-test-cn-zone2-0   2/2     Running   0          84m
    ```

    The preceding result shows that `zone1`, `zone2`, and `zone3` each have only one OBServer node, the values of `READY` are all `2/2`, and the values of `STATUS` are all `Running`, indicating that the scale-in is successful.
