# Delete a cluster

This topic describes how to delete an OceanBase cluster by using ob-operator.

## Procedure

Take the `ob-test` cluster in the `obcluster` namespace as an example.

1. Run the following command to query the custom resources of all OceanBase clusters:

   ```shell
   kubectl get obcluster -A
   ```

   Here is an example of typical output:

   ```shell
   NAMESPACE   NAME      AGE
   obcluster   ob-test   148m
   ```

2. Run the following command to delete a specific OceanBase cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectl delete obcluster ob-test -n obcluster
   ```

3. Check whether the cluster and related resources are deleted.

   After you delete a cluster, you can run the following commands to check whether the related resources are deleted.

   * Check whether the pods are deleted:

      ```shell
      kubectl get pods -n obcluster
      ```

   * Check whether the tenants are deleted:

      ```shell
      kubectl get tenants -n obcluster
      ```

   * Check whether the backup files are deleted:

      ```shell
      kubectl get tenantbackups -n obcluster
      ```
