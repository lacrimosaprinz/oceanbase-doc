# Delete a tenant

This topic describes how to use ob-operator to delete a tenant from a Kubernetes environment.

## Procedure

You can delete the tenant configuration file `tenant.yaml` and apply the deletion to drop a tenant. For more information about the configuration file, see [GitHub](https://github.com/oceanbase/ob-operator/blob/master/deploy/tenant.yaml).

Run the following command to delete a tenant. The command deletes the custom resource of the corresponding tenant in the current Kubernetes cluster.

```shell
kubectl delete -f tenant.yaml
```

Execute the following statement to check whether the custom resource of the deleted tenant exists in the current Kubernetes cluster.

If not, the tenant is deleted.

```shell
kubectl get tenant -A -o yaml
```
