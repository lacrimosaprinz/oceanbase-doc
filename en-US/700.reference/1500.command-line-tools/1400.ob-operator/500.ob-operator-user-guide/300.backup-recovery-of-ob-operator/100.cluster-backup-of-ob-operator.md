# Back up a cluster

This topic describes how to back up data in a cluster by taking OceanBase Database V3.x as an example.

## Prerequisites

* To back up data to a network file system (NFS), ensure that backup volumes have been configured when the OceanBase cluster is deployed, the NFS can be accessed, and you have the read and write permissions on the NFS.

* At least one major compaction has been completed for the cluster to be backed up.

## Configure a backup task

The content of the configuration file for cluster backup is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: cloud.oceanbase.com/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: ob-backup
  namespace: obcluster
spec:
  destPath: file:///ob-backup
  source:
    clusterName: ob-test
    clusterID: 1
    clusterNamespace: obcluster
  schedule:
  - name: f # f/i
    schedule: '*/10 * * * *'
  - name: i
    schedule: '*/5 * * * *'
  secret: backup-secret
```

The parameters are described as follows:

* `destPath`: the storage path of the backup data. NFS and OSS are supported. A NFS path is in the format of `file:///backuppath`. An OSS path is in the format of `oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/?host=xxx.aliyuninc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&delete_mode=delete'`.

* `source`: the information about the source cluster, including the cluster name, cluster ID, and namespace where the cluster resides.

* `schedule`: the scheduling strategies. You can set strategies respectively named `f` and `i`, which respectively indicate full data backup and incremental data backup. The backup cycle is specified by using a cron expression.

* `secret`: the secret configured for backup data encryption.

Here is a configuration example of `secret`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: backup-secret
  namespace: obcluster
data:
  # base64 encoded data
  incremental: ******
  full: ******
```

The key parameters are described as follows:

* `incremental`: the encryption password for incremental backup.

* `full`: the encryption password for full backup.

## Initiate a backup

Run the following command to create a backup related secret:

```shell
kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
```

Run the following command to create a custom resource for data backup:

```shell
kubectl apply -f backup.yaml
```

## View the backup status

* Run the following command to view the cluster backup status:

   ```shell
   kubectl get backups -A
   ```

   The returned result is as follows:

   ```shell
   NAMESPACE   NAME        AGE
   obcluster   ob-backup   16h
   ```

* Run the following command to view the backup details:

  ```shell
  kubectl get backup ob-backup -n obcluster -o yaml
  ```

  The returned result is as follows:

  ```shell
  apiVersion: cloud.oceanbase.com/v1
  kind: Backup

    annotations:
