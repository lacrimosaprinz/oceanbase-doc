# Restore data from a backup

This topic describes how to restore data from a backup.

## Prerequisites

* Data has been backed up and can be restored.

* The cluster is running properly and the available resources are sufficient to create a recovery tenant.

## Restore data in OceanBase Database V3.x

### Configuration file for restoring data

The content of the configuration file for restoring data is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: cloud.oceanbase.com/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: ob-restore
  namespace: obcluster
spec:
  savePoint:
    value: "2023-07-07 15:05:35.536997"
  source:
    clusterName: ob-test
    clusterID: 1
    tenant: tenant1
    path:
      root: file:///ob-backup
  decryptionSecret: backup-secret
  dest:
    clusterName: ob-test
    clusterID: 1
    tenant: ob_restore
    kmsEncryptInfo: ''
    topology:
      - zone: zone1
        unitNum: 1
        type:
          name: FUll
          replica: 1
        priority: 3
        resource:
          maxCPU: 2500m
          minCPU: 2
          memorySize: 1Gi
```

The parameters are described as follows:

* `savePoint`: the target savepoint to which data is to be restored.
* `source`: the information about the backup data, including the information about the cluster, tenant, and addresses of backup files.
* `decryptionSecret`: the secret for decrypting backup data if data encryption is configured during data backup. Make sure that the secret or the password in the secret is the same as that configured during backup.
* `dest`: the destination of restore, including the information about the cluster, the name of the tenant to be restored, and the resource configuration of the tenant.

### Initiate data restore

Run the following command to initiate data restore:

```shell
kubectl apply -f restore.yaml
```

### View the data restore status

* Run the following command to view the restore result:

   ```shell
   kubectl get restore -A
   ```

   The returned result is as follows:

   ```shell
   NAMESPACE   NAME               AGE
   obcluster   cluster-restore    139m
   ```

* Run the following command to view the detailed restore result:

   ```shell
   kubectl get restore cluster-restore -n obcluster -o yaml
   ```

   The returned result is as follows:

   ```shell
   apiVersion: cloud.oceanbase.com/v1

## Check whether the tenant is restored

* Connect to the sys tenant.

   ```shell
   mysql -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -uroot oceanbase -A -c
   ```

* Check whether the target tenant is restored.

   ```sql
   select * from DBA_OB_TENANTS;
   ```
