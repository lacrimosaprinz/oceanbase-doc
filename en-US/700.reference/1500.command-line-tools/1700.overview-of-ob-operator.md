# Overview of ob-operator

## What is ob-operator

The ob-operator is a tool based on the Kubernetes Operator pattern for managing OceanBase clusters within Kubernetes. It offers a simple and reliable way to implement containerized deployment of OceanBase clusters, which can simplify the operations and maintenance of OceanBase. The ob-operator defines various OceanBase-related resources and implements the corresponding coordination logic, so you can manage OceanBase in a declarative manner just like you would do with Kubernetes' native resources.

## Features of ob-operator

* OceanBase Cluster Management
  
  By creating or modifying the custom resource definitions (CRD) `obclusters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com`, you could deploy and manage OceanBase database clusters, which specifically includes creating clusters, bootstrapping clusters, scaling clusters in and out, modifying cluster parameters and so on.

* OceanBase Tenant Management

  You can manage OceanBase database tenants easily by creating or modifying the CRD `obtenants.oceanbase.oceanbase.com`, specifically including creating tenants, adjusting distribution of replicas, managing standby tenants, and managing backups of tenants etc.

* High availability of OceanBase database

  The ob-operator provides an automatic failover capability, allowing it to automatically recover the cluster in the event of a failure, as long as a majority of the cluster is still available, to ensure the cluster's normal operation.
