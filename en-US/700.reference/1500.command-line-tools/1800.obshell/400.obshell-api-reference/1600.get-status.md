## Examples

### Sample request

GET xxx.xxx.xxx:2886/api/v1/status

### Sample response

```json
{
  "successful": true,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-09T20:01:52.466963232+08:00",
  "duration": 3,
  "status": 200,
  "traceId": "",
  "data": {
    "agent": {
        "ip": "xxx.xxx.1",
        "port": 2886,
        "identity": "CLUSTER AGENT"
    },
    "state": 2,
    "version": "4.2.1.0-0",
    "pid": 74314,
    "startAt": 1704801582437828890,
    "port": 2886,
    "obState": 3,
    "underMaintenance": false
  }
}
```

In the sample response, the identity of the node is `CLUSTER AGENT`, and the OceanBase cluster normally provides services and is not under maintenance.
