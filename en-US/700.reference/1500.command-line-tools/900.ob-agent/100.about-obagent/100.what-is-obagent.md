# What is OBAgent

This topic describes OceanBase Agent (OBAgent) and its features.

OBAgent is a framework for data monitoring and collection as well as O&M.  In terms of monitoring, OBAgent supports data pushing and pulling for different scenarios. By default, OBAgent supports plug-ins for server data collection, database metrics collection, log collection, monitoring data label processing, and HTTP service of the Prometheus protocol. OBAgent allows you to push data to Pushgateway, vmagent, Elasticsearch, Simple Log Service (SLS), and Alertmanager. To enable data collection from other sources or customize the data processing flow, you only need to develop the corresponding plug-ins.  In terms of O&M, OBAgent allows you to configure hot updates. It also provides APIs for OBAgent O&M, file operations, and RPM package operations. You can use these APIs as needed.

## Features

OBAgent has the following features:

* Developed in the Go language, without the necessity for external dependencies
* Plug-in driven, which makes it easy to develop

## Architecture

OBAgent consists of four processes: agentd, mgragent, monagent, and agentctl.

| Process | Description |
|----------|------|
| agentd | Serves as a daemon to start or stop the mgragent and monagent processes. If the mgragent or monagent process exits abnormally, the agentd process automatically restarts them to ensure service availability. The agentd process also runs tasks to limit the CPU utilization and memory usage of the mgragent and monagent processes.  |
| mgragent | Provides O&M features, for example, restarts or reinstalls OBAgent, and manages files, installation packages, and configurations.  |
| monagent | Monitors database performance parameters, application logs, server performance and resource parameters, tenant resource and performance parameters, and SQL statement and transaction parameters. You can obtain the data collected during monitoring in either pushing or pulling mode.  |
| agentctl | Supports O&M on the command-line interface (CLI). The agentctl process does not contain business logic, but provides an operation portal in the form of CLI. It allows you to start or stop processes and change configurations on the CLI.  |
