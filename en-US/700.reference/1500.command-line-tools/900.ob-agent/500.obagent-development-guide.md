# OBAgent development guide

OBAgent is a plug-in driven framework that monitors OceanBase Database and collects its metrics. To extend the features of OBAgent or customize the data processing flow, you can develop corresponding plug-ins as needed. To develop a plug-in, you only need to implement the basic interfaces of the plug-in and the interfaces of the corresponding plug-in type.

## OBAgent data processing flow

![OBAgent data processing flowchart](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.1/700.reference/1500.command-line-tools/900.ob-agent/OBAgent.jpg)

The data processing flow of OBAgent involves data collection, processing, and reporting. The required plug-ins include the input plug-in (Source), the processing plug-in (Processor), and the output plug-in (Sink). For more information about the plug-ins, see the "External plug-ins" section in this topic.

## External plug-ins

The following table lists the types of plug-ins supported by OBAgent.

| Plug-in | Description |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Source | A plug-in that collects various time-series metrics, including system information and application information.  |
| Processor | A plug-in that processes data in serial mode.  |
| Sink | A plug-in that outputs data in pushing or pulling mode.  |

### Definition of the Source plug-in interface

```javascript
type Source interface {
    Start(out chan<- []*message.Message) (err error)
    Stop()
}
```

The Source plug-in starts to collect data in `Start` and writes the data to `out`. ​

### Definition of the Processor plug-in interface

```javascript
type Processor interface {
    Start(in <-chan []*message.Message, out chan<- []*message.Message) (err error)
    Stop()
}
```

The Processor plug-in reads data from `in`, processes the data, and then writes the processed data to `out`. ​

### Definition of the Sink plug-in interface

```javascript
type Sink interface {
    Start(in <-chan []*message.Message) error
    Stop()
}
```

The Sink plug-in reads data from `in`, and places the data into the cache for pulling in pulling mode, or directly pushes the data to the destination in pushing mode.

## Data structure of a message

Data is forwarded as a message in the data processing flow of OBAgent. The data structure of a message is as follows:

```javascript
type Message struct {
    name        string
    fields      []FieldEntry
    tags        []TagEntry
    timestamp   time.Time
    msgType     Type
    tagSorted   bool
    fieldSorted bool
    id          string
}
```
