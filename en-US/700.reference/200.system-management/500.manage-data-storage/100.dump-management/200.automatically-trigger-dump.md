# Automatically trigger a minor compaction

This topic describes how a minor compaction is automatically triggered.

When you create a tenant, you can specify the memory for the tenant. The memory of a tenant consists of scalable memory and a MemTable. When the usage of the MemTable of a tenant reaches the limit specified by `memstore_limit_percentage * freeze_trigger_percentage`, a freeze (the preparation for a minor compaction) is automatically triggered. Then, the system schedules a minor compaction. A major compaction is automatically triggered when specified conditions are met during the minor compaction. For more information, see [Automatically trigger a major compaction](../200.merge-management/200.automatic-merge-triggering.md).

For more information about the `memstore_limit_percentage` and `freeze_trigger_percentage` parameters, see [Modify minor compaction settings](../100.dump-management/500.modify-dump-configuration.md).
