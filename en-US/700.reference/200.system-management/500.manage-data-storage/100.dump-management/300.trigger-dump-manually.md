# Manually initiate a minor compaction

You can execute the `ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE` statement in the `sys` tenant to manually initiate a minor compaction at the tenant, zone, server, log stream, or tablet level.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Select a proper minor compaction type as needed.

   * Minor compaction at the tenant level

      You can initiate a minor compaction for one or more tenants by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT [=] all_user | all | all_meta | tenant_name [, tenant_name ...];
      ```

      Here are some examples:

      * Initiate a minor compaction for the sys tenant

         ```sql
         obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE;
         ```

      * Initiate a minor compaction for all user tenants from the sys tenant

         ```sql
         obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT = all_user;
         ```

         or

         ```sql
         obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT = all;
         ```

         <main id="notice" type='explain'>
          <h4>Note</h4>
          <p>In OceanBase Database V4.2.1 and later, the <code>TENANT = all_user</code> and <code>TENANT = all</code> settings express the same semantics. If you want an operation to take effect on all tenants, we recommend that you use <code>TENANT = all_user</code>. <code>TENANT = all</code> will be deprecated. </p>
          </main>

      * Initiate a minor compaction for all meta tenants from the sys tenant

         ```sql
         obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT = all_meta;
         ```

      * Initiate a minor compaction for a specified tenant from the sys tenant

         ```sql
         obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT = tenant1;
         ```

   * Minor compaction at the zone level

      You can initiate a minor compaction for a specified zone by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE ZONE [=] zone_name;
      ```

      Here is an example:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE ZONE = zone1;
      ```

   * Minor compaction at the server level

      You can initiate a minor compaction for one or more specified OBServer nodes by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE SERVER = ('ip:port' [, 'ip:port'...]);
      ```

      Here is an example:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE SERVER = ('xx.xx.xx.xx:2882','xx.xx.xx.xx:2882');
      ```

   * Minor compaction at the log stream level

      You can initiate a minor compaction for a specified log stream of a specified tenant by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT [=] tenant_name LS [=] ls_id;
      ```

      In the syntax, `tenant_name` specifies the name of a tenant and `ls_id` specifies the ID of a log stream in the tenant. You can query the `oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLET_TO_LS` view for IDs of log streams.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT = t1 LS = 1001;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

      After you execute this statement, the system performs a minor compaction for all tablets in the specified log stream of the specified tenant.

   * Minor compaction at the tablet level

      You can initiate a minor compaction for a specified tablet in a specified tenant by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT [=] tenant_name TABLET_ID = tid;
      ```

      Alternatively, you can initiate a minor compaction for a specified tablet in a specified log stream of a specified tenant by using the following SQL syntax:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT [=] tenant_name LS [=] ls_id TABLET_ID = tid;
      ```

      In the syntax, `tenant_name` specifies the name of a tenant, `ls_id` specifies the ID of a log stream in the tenant, and `tid` specifies the ID of a tablet in the log stream. You can query the `oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLET_TO_LS` view for the IDs of log streams and tablets.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT = t1 tablet_id = 200001;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected

      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MINOR FREEZE TENANT = t1 LS = 1001 tablet_id = 200001;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```
