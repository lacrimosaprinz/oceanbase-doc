# Manually initiate a major compaction

You can manually initiate a major compaction.

## Prerequisites

Before a major compaction is triggered, make sure that global major compaction is enabled. Global major compaction is controlled by the cluster-level parameter `enable_major_freeze`. The default value is `True`, which specifies to enable global major compaction.

If global major compaction is disabled for the current cluster, perform the following steps to enable this feature:

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Verify that global major compaction is enabled.

   ```sql
   obclient> SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'enable_major_freeze';
   ```

3. If global major compaction is not enabled, execute the following statement to enable the feature.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_major_freeze='True';
   ```

   For more information about the `enable_major_freeze` parameter, see [enable_major_freeze](../../../800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/7200.enable_major_freeze.md).

## Manually initiate a major compaction from the sys tenant

You can initiate a major compaction for the current tenant, all tenants, or specified tenants from the sys tenant.

To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Use the following syntax to initiate a major compaction:



   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MAJOR FREEZE TENANT [=] all_user | all | all_meta | tenant_name [, tenant_name ...];
   ```

   Here, `[=]` indicates that the equal sign (=) is optional.

   Here are some examples:

   * Initiate a major compaction for the sys tenant

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MAJOR FREEZE TENANT;
      ```

   * Initiate a major compaction for all user tenants from the sys tenant

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MAJOR FREEZE TENANT = all_user;
      ```

      or

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MAJOR FREEZE TENANT = all;
      ```

     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>In OceanBase Database V4.2.1 and later, the <code>TENANT = all_user</code> and <code>TENANT = all</code> settings express the same semantics. If you want an operation to take effect on all tenants, we recommend that you use <code>TENANT = all_user</code>. <code>TENANT = all</code> will be deprecated. </p>

   * Initiate a major compaction for all meta tenants from the sys tenant

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MAJOR FREEZE TENANT = all_meta;
      ```

   * Initiate a major compaction for a specified tenant from the sys tenant

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MAJOR FREEZE TENANT = tenant1,tenant2;
      ```

## Manually initiate a major compaction for a user tenant

A user tenant can initiate a major compaction only for itself.

1. Log on to the database as an administrator of a user tenant.

2. Initiate a major compaction for the current tenant.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM MAJOR FREEZE;
   ```
