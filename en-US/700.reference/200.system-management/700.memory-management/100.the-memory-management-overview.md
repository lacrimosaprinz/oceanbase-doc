# Overview

OceanBase Database is a quasi-memory distributed database that supports the multi-tenant architecture, which puts forward high requirements for the management and use of large memory. OceanBase Database occupies most memory of servers and manages the memory in a unified manner.

When you create a tenant for new services, the tenant can occupy a part of the allocatable memory. The number of allocated CPU cores and the size of allocated memory depends on the scale of the new services. If the allocatable CPU and memory are insufficient, you can scale out the OceanBase cluster to meet the requirements of the ever-growing business.
