# Multi-tenant threads of OceanBase Database

This topic describes how the multi-tenant threads of OceanBase Database work.

OceanBase Database is a distributed database that supports the multi-tenant architecture. When an OBServer node receives requests from different tenants, the OBServer node uses tenant-specific threads to handle the requests and returns the results to a client, such as the OBClient. The results can also be returned by an application through an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP). During this process, the background system threads of OceanBase Database handle both system tasks and tasks that are shared by multiple tenants. The healthy running of all threads supports the stable running of OBServer nodes and ensures reliable and highly available data services. The following section describes how OceanBase Database handles three basic types of tenant requests received by OBServer nodes in the multi-tenant thread architecture.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1

When an OBServer node receives an SQL request of the online transaction processing (OLTP) type, which is sent from a client to Tenant A (with an ID of `1014`), a tenant thread locally executes the request. The request is executed in the following manner:

1. A client sends the req1 request to an OBServer node.

2. req1 enters a tenant request queue. On the OBServer node, such SQL requests enter the tenant request queue queue4.

3. Multi-tenant worker threads inspect request queues. When the TNT_1014 thread of Tenant `1014` identifies req1, the thread obtains req1.

4. The TNT_1014 thread executes req1.

5. The TNT_1014 thread returns the execution results and the return value to the client.

### Scenario 2

When an OBServer node receives a remote procedure call (RPC) request, such as a distributed OLTP SQL request that is sent from another OBServer node in Tenant B (with an ID of `1011`), a tenant thread executes the request. The RPC request is executed in the following manner:

1. An OBServer node in a tenant serves as an RPC client and sends an RPC request req1 to the current OBServer node.

2. req1 returns an OLTP SQL request and enters the tenant request queue queue2.

3. Multi-tenant worker threads inspect request queues. When the TNT_1011 thread of Tenant `1011` identifies req1, the thread obtains req1.

4. The TNT_1011 thread executes req1.

5. The TNT_1011 thread returns the execution results and the return value to the remote OBServer node.

### Scenario 3

When an OBServer node receives a PX SQL request that is sent from a client to Tenant C (with an ID of `1013`), all SQL requests are locally executed. The request is executed in the following manner:

1. A client sends the req1 request to an OBServer node.

2. req1 enters the request queue of the tenant. In OceanBase Database, regular SQL requests enter Queue 4.

3. Multi-tenant worker threads inspect request queues. When the TNT_1013 thread of Tenant C (with an ID of `1013`) identifies req1 that needs to be processed, the thread retrieves req1 from the queue.

4. The tenant thread serves as the local scheduler and drives the PX thread to execute the request.

5. After req1 is executed, the thread returns the execution results and the return value to the client.

## Related parameters

### cpu_quota_concurrency

The `min_cpu` parameter (a resource unit parameter) and the `cpu_quota_concurrency` parameter (a system parameter) determine the number of active threads of a tenant.

Number of active threads of a tenant = `min_cpu` × `cpu_quota_concurrency`

The default value is `4`, and the value range is \[1,20\]. This parameter takes effect immediately after it is modified.

If you deploy and use OceanBase Database in a standard environment, we recommend that you use the default value.

### workers_per_cpu_quota

The `max_cpu` parameter (a resource unit parameter) and the `workers_per_cpu_quota` parameter (a system parameter) determine the maximum number of threads of a tenant.

Maximum number of threads of a tenant = `max_cpu` × `workers_per_cpu_quota`

The default value is `10`, and the value range is \[2, 20\]. This parameter takes effect immediately after it is modified.

If you deploy and use OceanBase Database in a standard environment, we recommend that you use the default value.
