# View the thread status

When your database is running, you can view the status of threads in the current cluster as needed to facilitate troubleshooting or performance diagnostics.

## Background information

Threads can be classified into worker threads and background threads. Worker threads are tenant-specific and therefore are also called tenant worker threads. Background threads contain both tenant-specific and non-tenant-specific threads.

## Procedure

1. Log on to a MySQL or Oracle tenant of the cluster as an administrator user.

2. Execute the following statement to view the status of threads.

   * MySQL mode

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_THREAD LIMIT 1;
     ```

      A sample query result is as follows:

     ```shell
     +----------------+----------+-----------+-------+-----------------+--------+------------+------------+-----------------------------------+-------------+
     | SVR_IP         | SVR_PORT | TENANT_ID | TID   | TNAME           | STATUS | LATCH_WAIT | LATCH_HOLD | TRACE_ID                          | CGROUP_PATH |
     +----------------+----------+-----------+-------+-----------------+--------+------------+------------+-----------------------------------+-------------+

   * Oracle mode

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM SYS.GV$OB_THREAD WHERE ROWNUM = 1;
     ```

      A sample query result is as follows:

     ```shell
     +----------------+----------+-----------+-------+-----------------+--------+------------+------------+-----------------------------------+-------------+
     | SVR_IP         | SVR_PORT | TENANT_ID | TID   | TNAME           | STATUS | LATCH_WAIT | LATCH_HOLD | TRACE_ID                          | CGROUP_PATH |
     +----------------+----------+-----------+-------+-----------------+--------+------------+------------+-----------------------------------+-------------+
     | 172.xx.xxx.xxx |     2882 |      1004 | 80041 | T1004_TTLTablet | Wait   | NULL       | NULL       | YB42AC1E87E9-00060BF9524E6A9C-0-0 |             |
     +----------------+----------+-----------+-------+-----------------+--------+------------+------------+-----------------------------------+-------------+
     1 row in set
     ```


   In the query result, each row indicates a thread. The query result may vary based on the query time. When a thread is created, the system adds a thread record in the table. When a thread ends, the system deletes the corresponding thread record from the table.

   Columns in the query result are described as follows.

   | Column | Description |
   |-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
   | SVR_IP | The IP address of the OBServer node where the current thread resides. |
   | SVR_PORT | The port number of the OBServer node where the current thread resides. |
   | TENANT_ID | The ID of the tenant to which the current thread belongs. The tenant ID of a process-level thread is 500.  |
   | TID | The ID of the thread. |
   | TNAME | The name of the thread. |
   | STATUS | The status of the thread. Valid values:<ul><li>`Run`: The thread is in the running state. </li><li>`Wait`: The thread is in the waiting state.</li><li>`Sleep`: The thread is in the sleep state.</li><li>`Join`: The thread is waiting for another thread to end.</li></ul> |
   | LATCH_WAIT | The address of the latch that the current thread is waiting for. |
   | LATCH_HOLD | The address of the latch held by the current thread. Multiple latches may be held by the thread. |
   | TRACE_ID | The ID of the trace executed by the current thread. |
   | CGROUP_PATH | The path of the cgroup to which the thread belongs. |
