# Background threads of OceanBase Database

This topic introduces some background threads of OceanBase Database and their features. In most cases, you do not need to understand how these threads are implemented.

## Background threads

Background threads are optimized along with the iteration of OceanBase Database. Some background threads may be eliminated or merged, and other background threads may be created in later versions.

| Thread | Module | Thread quantity | Purpose |

The thread helps clear the transaction context. </li>   <li>Checks the replica table status of the current partition every 10s. </li>   <li>Refreshes the clogs cached in the current partition every 10s. </li></ol> |
