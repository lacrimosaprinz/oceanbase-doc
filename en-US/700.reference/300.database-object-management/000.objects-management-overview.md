# Overview

Objects are an important part of a database. General database objects include tables, indexes, views, and triggers.

In OceanBase Database V4.0.0, object IDs (object_id) are used to globally identify database objects. Object IDs are unique within a tenant.

Object IDs are assigned to the following database objects:

* Tables

* Table partitions

* Databases

* Users

* Roles

* Sequences

* Outlines

* Constraints

* Foreign keys

* Synonyms

* User-defined functions (UDFs)

* Procedural Language (PL) user-defined types (UDTs), routines, and packages

* Triggers

* Keystores that contain master keys

* LABEL_SE_POLICY, LABEL_SE_COMPONENT, LABEL_SE_LABEL, and LABEL_SE_USER_LEVEL

* Tablespaces

* Profiles

* Audits

* DBLinks

* Directories

* Contexts
