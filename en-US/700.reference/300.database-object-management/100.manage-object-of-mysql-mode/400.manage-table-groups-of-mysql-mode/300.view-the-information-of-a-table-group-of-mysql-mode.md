# Query information about a table group

After you create a table group, you can query its information, including the `SHARDING` attribute, tables in the table group, time when the table group was created, and location information of tables in the table group.

## Query the SHARDING attribute of a table group

### Query table group attributes and partition information about tables in the table group through views

You can query the `CDB_OB_TABLEGROUPS` view in the sys tenant and the `DBA_OB_TABLEGROUPS` view in a MySQL user tenant for the `SHARDING` attribute of a table group and the partition information about tables in the table group. A sample statement is as follows:

* sys tenant

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLEGROUPS WHERE tablegroup_name = 'tblgroup1';
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-----------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
   | TENANT_ID | TABLEGROUP_NAME | PARTITIONING_TYPE | SUBPARTITIONING_TYPE | PARTITION_COUNT | DEF_SUBPARTITION_COUNT | PARTITIONING_KEY_COUNT | SUBPARTITIONING_KEY_COUNT | SHARDING |
   +-----------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
   |      1002 | tblgroup1       | NONE              | NONE                 |            NULL |                   NULL |                   NULL |                      NULL | ADAPTIVE |
   |      1004 | TBLGROUP1       | NONE              | NONE                 |            NULL |                   NULL |                   NULL |                      NULL | NONE     |
   +-----------+-----------------+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
   2 rows in set
   ```

* MySQL user tenant

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TABLEGROUPS WHERE tablegroup_name = 'tblgroup1';
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-----------------+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
   | TABLEGROUP_NAME | PARTITIONING_TYPE | SUBPARTITIONING_TYPE | PARTITION_COUNT | DEF_SUBPARTITION_COUNT | PARTITIONING_KEY_COUNT | SUBPARTITIONING_KEY_COUNT | SHARDING |
   +-----------------+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
   | tblgroup1       | NONE              | NONE                 |            NULL |                   NULL |                   NULL |                      NULL | ADAPTIVE |
   +-----------------+-------------------+----------------------+-----------------+------------------------+------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
   1 row in set
   ```

In the query results above:

* `TENANT_ID` indicates the ID of the tenant to which the table group belongs.

* `TABLEGROUP_NAME` indicates the name of the table group.

* `PARTITIONING_TYPE`, `SUBPARTITIONING_TYPE`, `PARTITION_COUNT`, `DEF_SUBPARTITION_COUNT`, `PARTITIONING_KEY_COUNT`, and `SUBPARTITIONING_KEY_COUNT` indicate the attributes of the table group with partition definitions in OceanBase Database V3.x. In OceanBase Database V4.2.1, the value of these attributes is `NONE` or `NULL`.

* `SHARDING` indicates the `SHARDING` attribute of the table group.

   * For a table group with the `SHARDING` attribute set to `NONE`, all partitions of all tables in the table group are aggregated on the same server, and no limitations are imposed on tables to be added to the table group.

   * For a table group with the `SHARDING` attribute set to `PARTITION`, the data of each table in the table group is scattered by partition. For a subpartitioned table in the table group, all subpartitions in each partition are aggregated together.

      A table to be added to the table group must have the same partition definition as existing tables in the table group, including the partitioning type, partition count, and partition value.

   * For a table group with the `SHARDING` attribute set to `ADAPTIVE`, the data of each table in the table group is adaptively scattered. In other words, data in partitioned tables is scattered by partition, and data in subpartitioned tables is scattered by subpartition in each partition.

      A table to be added to the table group must have the same partition definition and subpartition definition as existing tables in the table group, including the partitioning type, partition count, and partition value.

### Query table group attributes and databases of tables in the table group through the SHOW TABLEGROUPS statement

You can also execute the `SHOW TABLEGROUPS` statement in the sys tenant or a MySQL user tenant to view the `SHARDING` attribute of a table group and the databases to which tables in the table group belong. A sample statement is as follows:

```sql
SHOW TABLEGROUPS WHERE tablegroup_name = 'tblgroup1';
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-----------------+------------+---------------+----------+
| Tablegroup_name | Table_name | Database_name | Sharding |
+-----------------+------------+---------------+----------+
| tblgroup1       | tbl3       | test          | ADAPTIVE |
+-----------------+------------+---------------+----------+
1 row in set
```

In the query result above:

* `Tablegroup_name` indicates the name of the table group.

* `Table_name` indicates the name of the table.

* `Database_name` indicates the name of the database to which the table belongs.

* `Sharding` indicates the `SHARDING` attribute of the table group.

   * For a table group with the `SHARDING` attribute set to `NONE`, all partitions of all tables in the table group are aggregated on the same server, and no limitations are imposed on tables to be added to the table group.

   * For a table group with the `SHARDING` attribute set to `PARTITION`, the data of each table in the table group is scattered by partition. For a subpartitioned table in the table group, all subpartitions in each partition are aggregated together.

      A table to be added to the table group must have the same partition definition as existing tables in the table group, including the partitioning type, partition count, and partition value.

   * For a table group with the `SHARDING` attribute set to `ADAPTIVE`, the data of each table in the table group is adaptively scattered. In other words, data in partitioned tables is scattered by partition, and data in subpartitioned tables is scattered by subpartition in each partition.

      A table to be added to the table group must have the same partition definition and subpartition definition as existing tables in the table group, including the partitioning type, partition count, and partition value.

## Query tables in a table group

You can query the `CDB_OB_TABLEGROUP_TABLES` view in the sys tenant or the `DBA_OB_TABLEGROUP_TABLES` view in a MySQL user tenant for the tables in a table group and the databases to which the tables belong. A sample statement is as follows:

* sys tenant

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLEGROUP_TABLES WHERE tablegroup_name = 'tblgroup1';
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-----------+-----------------+-------+------------+----------+
   | TENANT_ID | TABLEGROUP_NAME | OWNER | TABLE_NAME | SHARDING |
   +-----------+-----------------+-------+------------+----------+
   |      1002 | tblgroup1       | test  | tbl3       | ADAPTIVE |
   |      1004 | TBLGROUP1       | SYS   | TBL3       | NONE     |
   +-----------+-----------------+-------+------------+----------+
   2 rows in set
   ```

* MySQL user tenant

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TABLEGROUP_TABLES WHERE tablegroup_name = 'tblgroup1';
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-----------------+-----------+------------+----------+
   | TABLEGROUP_NAME | OWNER     | TABLE_NAME | SHARDING |
   +-----------------+-----------+------------+----------+
   | tblgroup1       | test      | tbl3       | ADAPTIVE |
   +-----------------+-----------+------------+----------+
   1 row in set
   ```

In the query results above:

* `TENANT_ID` indicates the ID of the tenant to which the table group belongs.

* `TABLEGROUP_NAME` indicates the name of the table group.

* `OWNER` indicates the database to which the table belongs.

* `TABLE_NAME` indicates the name of the table.

* `SHARDING` indicates the `SHARDING` attribute of the table group.

   * For a table group with the `SHARDING` attribute set to `NONE`, all partitions of all tables in the table group are aggregated on the same server, and no limitations are imposed on tables to be added to the table group.

   * For a table group with the `SHARDING` attribute set to `PARTITION`, the data of each table in the table group is scattered by partition. For a subpartitioned table in the table group, all subpartitions in each partition are aggregated together.

      A table to be added to the table group must have the same partition definition as existing tables in the table group, including the partitioning type, partition count, and partition value.

   * For a table group with the `SHARDING` attribute set to `ADAPTIVE`, the data of each table in the table group is adaptively scattered. In other words, data in partitioned tables is scattered by partition, and data in subpartitioned tables is scattered by subpartition in each partition.

      A table to be added to the table group must have the same partition definition and subpartition definition as existing tables in the table group, including the partitioning type, partition count, and partition value.

## Query the creation time of a table group

You can query the `CDB_OBJECTS` view in the sys tenant or the `DBA_OBJECTS` view in a MySQL user tenant for information such as the creation time and last DDL operation of a table group. A sample statement is as follows:

* sys tenant

   ```sql
   SELECT OBJECT_NAME,CREATED, LAST_DDL_TIME FROM oceanbase.CDB_OBJECTS WHERE object_name = 'tblgroup1';
   ```

   A sample query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
   | OBJECT_NAME | CREATED             | LAST_DDL_TIME       |
   +-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
   | tblgroup1   | 2023-06-27 14:58:53 | 2023-06-27 15:15:54 |
   | TBLGROUP1   | 2023-06-27 15:25:30 | 2023-06-27 15:25:30 |
   +-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
   2 rows in set
   ```

* MySQL user tenant

   ```sql
   SELECT OBJECT_NAME,CREATED, LAST_DDL_TIME FROM oceanbase.DBA_OBJECTS WHERE object_name = 'tblgroup1';
   ```

   A sample query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
   | OBJECT_NAME | CREATED             | LAST_DDL_TIME       |
   +-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
   | tblgroup1   | 2023-06-27 14:58:53 | 2023-06-27 15:15:54 |
   +-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

In the query results above:

* `OBJECT_NAME` indicates the object name, which is the name of the queried table group.
* `CREATED` indicates the time when the table group was created.
* `LAST_DDL_TIME` indicates the time when the last DDL operation was performed.

## Query the location information about tables in a table group

You can query the `DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS` view in the sys tenant or a MySQL user tenant for the location information about tables in a table group, including the tablet ID of each partition, mappings between tablet IDs and log stream IDs, and location information of log stream replicas. A sample statement is as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE tablegroup_name = 'tblgroup1';
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+---------------+------------+----------+------------+----------------+-------------------+------------+---------------+-----------+-------+-------+----------------+----------+----------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+-----------------+---------------+----------+

   * `USER TABLE`: a user table.
   * `SYSTEM TABLE`: a system table, which is an index table created by the system.
   * `LOB AUX TABLE`: a LOB auxiliary table, which is created by the system to implement LOB columns.

* `PARTITION_NAME` indicates the name of the partition. For a non-partitioned table, the value is `NULL` by default.

* `SUBPARTITION_NAME` indicates the name of the subpartition. The value `NULL` indicates that no subpartition exists.

* `INDEX_NAME` indicates the name of the index table. If the table is not an index table, the value is `NULL`.

* `DATA_TABLE_ID` indicates the ID of the primary table. If the table is not an index table or LOB table, the value is `NULL`.

   * For a table group with the `SHARDING` attribute set to `PARTITION`, the data of each table in the table group is scattered by partition. For a subpartitioned table in the table group, all subpartitions in each partition are aggregated together.

      A table to be added to the table group must have the same partition definition as existing tables in the table group, including the partitioning type, partition count, and partition value.

   * For a table group with the `SHARDING` attribute set to `ADAPTIVE`, the data of each table in the table group is adaptively scattered. In other words, data in partitioned tables is scattered by partition, and data in subpartitioned tables is scattered by subpartition in each partition.

      A table to be added to the table group must have the same partition definition and subpartition definition as existing tables in the table group, including the partitioning type, partition count, and partition value.
