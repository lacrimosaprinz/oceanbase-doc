# Drop a materialized view

This topic describes how to drop a materialized view by using SQL statements. 

## Required privileges

You need the `DROP TABLE` privilege to drop a materialized view. For more information about privileges in OceanBase Database, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](../../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md). 

## Considerations

A materialized view that is separately dropped is not moved to the recycle bin. 

## Syntax

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW [IF EXISTS] materialized_view_list [opt_drop_behavior];

materialized_view_list:
    [ database. ]materialized_view [,[ database. ]materialized_view]...

opt_drop_behavior:
    RESTRICT | CASCADE
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| IF EXISTS | Specifies whether to check the existence of the materialized view to be dropped. If you specify `IF EXISTS` and the materialized view to be dropped does not exist, the system does not report an error during execution. If you do not specify this parameter and the materialized view to be dropped does not exist, the system reports an error during execution. This parameter is optional.  |
| database. | The name of the database in which the materialized view is located. This parameter is optional. If you do not specify the `database.` parameter, the database in which you execute the statement is used by default.  |
| materialized_view | The name of the materialized view.  |
| RESTRICT \| CASCADE | The drop behavior. This parameter is optional. <ul><li>The default value `CASCADE` specifies to drop other objects that depend on the materialized view along with it. </li><li>The value `RESTRICT` specifies not to drop the materialized view if other objects depend on it. </li></ul> |

## Example

Drop the `mv_test_tbl1` materialized view in the `test_db` database. 

```sql
obclient [test]> DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW test_db.mv_test_tbl1;
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
