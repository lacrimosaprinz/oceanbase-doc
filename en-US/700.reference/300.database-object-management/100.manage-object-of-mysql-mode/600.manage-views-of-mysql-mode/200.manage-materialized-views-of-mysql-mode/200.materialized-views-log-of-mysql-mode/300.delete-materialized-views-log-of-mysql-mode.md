# Drop a materialized view log

This topic describes how to drop a materialized view log by using SQL statements. 

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>When you drop a materialized view log, if a transaction is running on the base table, the drop operation is blocked until the transaction is completed. </p>
</main>

## Required privileges

You need the `DROP TABLE` privilege to drop a materialized view log. For more information about privileges in OceanBase Database, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](../../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md). 

## Considerations

A materialized view log that is separately dropped is not moved to the recycle bin. 

## Syntax

The syntax for dropping a materialized view log is as follows:

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON [database.] table;
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| database. | The database where the base table of the materialized view log is located. If you do not specify the `database.` parameter, the database in which you execute the statement is used by default.  |
| table | The name of the base table of the materialized view log.  |

## Example

Drop the materialized view log on the `test_tbl1` table. 

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON test_tbl1;
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
