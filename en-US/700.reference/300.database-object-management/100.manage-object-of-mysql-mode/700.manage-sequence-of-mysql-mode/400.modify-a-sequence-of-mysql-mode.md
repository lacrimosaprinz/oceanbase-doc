# Modify a sequence

After you create a sequence, you can use the `ALTER SEQUENCE` statement to modify the attributes of the sequence. OceanBase Database allows you to change the start value, minimum value, maximum value, increment step, and cycle of a sequence.

The SQL syntax for modifying a sequence is as follows:

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE [database_name.]sequence_name
{
[RESTART]
|[START WITH int_value]
|[MINVALUE int_value | NOMINVALUE]
|[MAXVALUE int_value | NOMAXVALUE]
|[INCREMENT BY int_value]
|[CACHE int_value | NOCACHE]
|[ORDER | NOORDER]
|[CYCLE | NOCYCLE]
};
```

To execute this statement, you must have the `ALTER` privilege.

Here is an example:

1. Change the maximum value of the `seq2` sequence and enable cyclic generation of sequence values.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq2 MAXVALUE 1024 CYCLE;
   ```
2. Change the start value of the sequence.

   * If the value of `INCREMENT BY` is greater than `0`, you can reset the sequence to make the sequence start from `MINVALUE`. If the value of `INCREMENT BY` is less than `0`, you can execute the following statement to reset the sequence to make the sequence start from `MAXVALUE`:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq3 RESTART;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

   * Execute the following statement to reset the sequence and make the sequence start from `3`:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq4 RESTART START WITH 3;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

   When you change the start value of a sequence, `RESTART` does not necessarily need to be behind the sequence name. It can be at any position in the statement. A sample statement is as follows:

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq4 START WITH 3 RESTART MINVALUE -100 CYCLE;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```
