# Drop a sequence

You can use the `DROP SEQUENCE` statement to drop a sequence.

The SQL syntax for dropping a sequence is as follows:

```sql
DROP SEQUENCE [IF EXISTS] [database_name.]sequence_name;
```

Note that:

* To execute this statement, you must have the `DROP` privilege.

* If you specify `IF EXISTS` in the statement, no error is reported even if the sequence to be dropped does not exist. Otherwise, the system reports an error.

* `database_name` specifies the database in which the sequence resides. If you do not specify `database_name`, the system takes by default that the sequence is in the current logon database.

For example, drop a sequence named `S1`.

```sql
obclient> DROP SEQUENCE S1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

For more information about the `DROP SEQUENCE` statement, see [DROP SEQUENCE](../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/600.sql-statement-of-mysql-mode/3900.drop-sequence-of-mysql-mode.md).
