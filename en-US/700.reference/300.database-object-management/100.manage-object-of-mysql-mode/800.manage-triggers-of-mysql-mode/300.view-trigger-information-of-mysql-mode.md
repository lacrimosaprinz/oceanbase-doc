# Query trigger information

You can query the information about existing triggers in a database, such as the definition, status, and syntax of each trigger.

You can query trigger information in the following ways:

* Use the `SHOW` statement

   ```sql
   obclient>SHOW TRIGGERS [FROM database_name];
   ```

   Here, `database_name` specifies the database name. If the `FROM database_name` clause is not used, the information about triggers in the current database is retrieved.

* Use a view

   ```sql
   obclient>SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers [where trigger_name = 'xx'];
   ```

   If the `WHERE` clause is not used, the information about all triggers is retrieved.
