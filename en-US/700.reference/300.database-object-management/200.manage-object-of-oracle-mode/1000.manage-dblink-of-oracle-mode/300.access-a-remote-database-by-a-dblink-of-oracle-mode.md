# Use a DBLink to access data in a remote database

You can use a DBLink to access objects, such as tables, views, synonyms, sequences, stored procedures, and UDFs in a remote database.

## Prerequisites

* You have created a DBLink. For more information about how to create a DBLink, see [Create a DBLink](100.create-a-dblink-of-oracle-mode.md).

* For OceanBase Database V4.2.1 and later, when you use the DBLink feature to access a remote Oracle database, you need to install and configure OCI 12.2 on all OBServer nodes in the cluster. Additionally, when you upgrade from OceanBase Database V4.2.1 or earlier to V4.2.1 or later, you will also need to reconfigure the previously configured OCI 11.2 to OCI 12.2.
  
  For more information about how to install and configure OCI 12.2, see [Install and configure OCI](600.install-and-configure-the-oci.md).

## Access data of tables in a remote database

You can execute the `SELECT... FROM table name@DBLink name` statement to access data in a table in the remote database. Here is an example:

```sql
SELECT select_expr_list
      FROM table_name@dblink_name
      WHERE where_conditions;

select_expr_list:
    table_name.*
    | table_alias_name.*
    | expr [[AS] column_alias_name]
```

where

* `select_expr_list` specifies the expressions or column names to be queried. Separate the column names with commas (,). An asterisk (\*) indicates all columns.

   * `table_name.*`: all columns in the specified table or view.

   * `table_alias_name.`: the alias of the table or view.

   * `expr [[AS] column_alias_name]`: the alias of the column or expression that you want to query. `AS` is optional.

* `table_name@dblink_name` specifies the tables to be queried in the remote database. Separate the tables with commas (,).

* `where_conditions` specifies the filter condition, which is optional. Only the data that meets the condition is returned.

For more information about the SQL statements for querying DBLinks, see [SIMPLE SELECT](../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/200.dml-of-oracle-mode/500.select-of-oracle-mode/100.simple-select-of-oracle-mode.md).

Example: Use a DBLink named `my_link` to query data of the `tbl1` table in the remote database:

```sql
obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM tbl1@my_link;
```

## Access sequences in a remote database

In OceanBase Database V4.2.1, you can access sequence values in a remote OceanBase database or Oracle database by using a DBLink.

Here is an example:

1. In the local database, create a table named `tbl1` and a DBLink named `my_link` that connects to an Oracle tenant of a remote OceanBase database.

   * Create a DBLink named `my_link`

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CREATE DATABASE LINK my_link CONNECT TO ob_user@oracle IDENTIFIED BY ****** HOST 'xx.xx.xx.xx:2881';
      ```

   * Create a table named `tbl1`

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (C1 int,C2 int);
      ```

2. Create a sequence named `seq` in the remote OceanBase database.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> CREATE SEQUENCE seq START WITH 10000 INCREMENT BY 1 CACHE 50 NOCYCLE;
   ```

   Confirm that the next value of the sequence is `10000`.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT seq.nextval FROM DUAL;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +---------+
   | NEXTVAL |
   +---------+
   |   10000 |
   +---------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   For more information about operations on sequences, see [Manage sequences](../600.management-sequence-of-oracle-mode.md).

3. In the local database, view the next and current values of the remote sequence by using the DBLink.

   * Query the next value

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT seq.nextval@my_link FROM DUAL;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +---------+
      | NEXTVAL |
      +---------+
      |   10001 |
      +---------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   * Query the current value

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT seq.currval@my_link FROM DUAL;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +---------+
      | CURRVAL |
      +---------+
      |   10001 |
      +---------+
      1 row in set
      ```

4. Insert the value of the remote sequence into the table in the local database by using the DBLink.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> INSERT INTO tbl1(C1,C2) VALUES (1,seq.nextval@my_link);
   ```

   View the data in the table.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
   ```


   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+-------+
   | C1   | C2    |
   +------+-------+
   |    1 | 10002 |
   +------+-------+
   1 row in set
   ```

To improve the performance of querying objects in the remote database, OceanBase Database may fail to obtain the latest `CURRVAL` value of a remote sequence in some scenarios. For example, if you execute the following statement, OceanBase Database sends the entire `SELECT` clause to the remote database for execution, and performs only data pull and insertion in the local database. After the statement is executed, you may not obtain the latest `CURRVAL` value by using the `SELECT seq.currval#my_link FROM DUAL;` statement.

```sql
INSERT INTO local_tbl1 SELECT remote_tbl1.NAME, seq.nextval@my_link FROM remote_tbl1@my_link;
```

## Call a stored procedure in a remote database

Starting from V4.2.1, OceanBase Database allows you to call stored procedures in remote Oracle databases through DBLink. However, currently, calling stored procedures in remote OceanBase databases is not supported.

Before you call a stored procedure in a remote Oracle database by using a DBLink, note that:

* The following basic data types of INOUT parameters are supported in the call of a stored procedure:

   * String data types such as VARCHAR2, VARCHAR, and CHAR

   * Numeric data types such as NUMBER, INT, INTEGER, FLOAT, and DOUBLE

   * DATE

   * TIMESTAMP

* In the call of a package of stored procedures, inout parameters of the following composite data types are supported:

   * [Record type](../../../500.sql-reference/300.pl-reference/300.pl-oracle/400.collections-and-records-oracle/800.record-oracle.md)

      The elements in a record must be of the following basic data types:

      * String data types such as VARCHAR2, VARCHAR, and CHAR

      * Numeric data types such as NUMBER, INT, INTEGER, FLOAT, and DOUBLE

      * DATE

      * TIMESTAMP

   However, if the remote Oracle database is of version 12c or earlier, the data types of parameters of a package must be any of the data types that appear in the routine parameters in the package. If the package type is defined only in the package but is not used in any routine parameters in the package, the package cannot be called.

   * [Nested table](../../../500.sql-reference/300.pl-reference/300.pl-oracle/400.collections-and-records-oracle/500.nested-table-oracle.md) and [associative array](../../../500.sql-reference/300.pl-reference/300.pl-oracle/400.collections-and-records-oracle/300.associative-array-oracle.md)

      The elements in a nested table or associative array must be of the record type or any of the following basic data types:

      * String data types such as VARCHAR2, VARCHAR, and CHAR

      * Numeric data types such as NUMBER, INT, INTEGER, FLOAT, and DOUBLE

      * DATE

      * TIMESTAMP

* You can use a DBLink to call the synonyms of a stored procedure or package in a remote Oracle database, and call the synonyms of remote stored procedures or packages created in the local database.

* You cannot use a DBLink to call remote packages of the constructor type.

Here are some examples: Assume that you have created, in the local OceanBase database, a DBLink named `orcl_link` to a remote Oracle database by executing the following statement:

```sql
obclient [SYS]> CREATE DATABASE LINK orcl_dblink CONNECT TO orcl_user@oracle IDENTIFIED BY ****** OCI HOST 'xx.xx.xx.xx:1521/ORCL';
```

* Call a simple stored procedure.

   1. Prepare the data environment.

      Create a table named `customer_info` to store customer information in the remote Oracle database.

      ```sql
      SQL> CREATE TABLE customer_info
             (id NUMBER,
             name VARCHAR2(20));
      ```

      Insert the following data into the table:

      ```sql
      SQL> INSERT INTO customer_info (id, name) VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith');
      ```

      ```sql
      SQL> INSERT INTO customer_info (id, name) VALUES (3, 'Mike Johnson');
      ```

      ```sql
      SQL> INSERT INTO customer_info (id, name) VALUES (4, 'Sarah Davis');
      ```

      Execute the `SELECT * FROM customer_info;` statement to query data in the table. The result is as follows:

      ```shell
              ID NAME
      ---------- --------------------
              2 Jane Smith
              3 Mike Johnson
              4 Sarah Davis
      ```

      Create a stored procedure named `get_customer_id` in the remote database to receive a `customer_id` parameter and return the ID of the customer.

      ```sql
      SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE get_customer_id (
           customer_id IN NUMBER
       )
       IS
       BEGIN
           DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Customer ID is: ' || customer_id);
       END;
       /
      ```

   2. Call the stored procedure from the local OceanBase database.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CALL get_customer_id@orcl_dblink(2);
      ```


   However, if you call the stored procedure by using the following statement, which is not supported at present, an error is returned:

   ```sql
   SELECT get_customer_id@orcl_dblink(2) FROM DUAL;
   ```

   In addition, you can create synonyms of the `get_customer_id` stored procedure in the remote Oracle database by using the following methods:

   * Create a synonym named `syn_remote_customer_id` for the stored procedure `get_customer_id` in the remote Oracle database.

     ```sql
     obclient [SYS]> CREATE OR REPLACE SYNONYM syn_local_customer_id FOR get_customer_id@orcl_dblink;
     ```

   * Create a synonym named `syn_local_customer_id` for the stored procedure `get_customer_id` in the local OceanBase database by using a DBLink.

     ```sql
     obclient [SYS]> CREATE OR REPLACE SYNONYM syn_local_customer_id FOR get_customer_id@orcl_dblink;
     ```

   You can execute the following statements to call these synonyms.

   * Call the synonym created in the remote Oracle database.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CALL syn_remote_customer_id@orcl_dblink(2);
      ```

   * Call the synonym created in the local OceanBase database.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CALL syn_local_customer_id(2);
      ```

* Call a stored procedure that contains inout parameters.

   Assume that you have created a table named `employees` to store employee information in the remote Oracle database by using the following statement:

   ```sql
   SQL> CREATE TABLE employees
         (name VARCHAR2(20),
         id NUMBER);
   ```

   You have created a stored procedure named `get_employee_info` to receive an input parameter `p_employee_id` and returns the name and ID of an employee. If the employee is not found, the stored procedure returns `Employee not found`. If other exceptions occur, the stored procedure returns `Error occurred`.

   ```sql
   SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE get_employee_info (
       p_employee_id IN NUMBER,
       p_employee_name OUT VARCHAR2,
       p_employee_id_out OUT NUMBER
   )
   IS
   BEGIN
       SELECT name, id INTO p_employee_name, p_employee_id_out
       FROM employees
       WHERE id = p_employee_id;
   EXCEPTION
       WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
           p_employee_name := 'Employee not found';
           p_employee_id_out := NULL;
       WHEN OTHERS THEN
           p_employee_name := 'Error occurred';
           p_employee_id_out := NULL;
   END;
   /
   ```

   The data types of the input parameter `employee_id` and output parameter `employee_name` meet the requirements. You can execute the following statements in the local database to call the stored procedure:

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
   ```

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> DECLARE
       v_employee_name VARCHAR2(20);
       v_employee_id NUMBER;
   BEGIN
       get_employee_info@orcl_dblink(1, v_employee_name, v_employee_id);
       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name: ' || v_employee_name);
       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee ID: ' || v_employee_id);
   END;
   /
   ```

   The preceding statement declares the `v_employee_name` and `v_employee_id` variables to receive the output of the stored procedure. The output is as follows:

   ```shell
   Employee Name: Employee not found
   Employee ID:
   ```

* Call a package of stored procedures with inout parameters of composite data types.

   The remote Oracle database contains a table named `tbl1_v` and a package named `pkg1`. The package type is nested table.

   ```sql
   SQL> CREATE TABLE tbl1_v(v varchar2(1000));
   ```

   ```sql
   SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE pkg1 AS
       TYPE ty1 IS TABLE OF varchar2(32767);
       TYPE ty2 IS TABLE OF NUMBER;
       v varchar2(1000);

       PROCEDURE pro1(param1 ty1);
       PROCEDURE pro1(param1 ty2);
       PROCEDURE pro1_out(param1 out ty1);
       PROCEDURE pro1_out(param1 out ty2);
       PROCEDURE pro1_inout(param1 in out ty1);
       PROCEDURE pro1_inout(param1 in out ty2);
   END;
   /
   ```

   The corresponding package body is as follows:

   ```sql
   SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY pkg1 IS
       PROCEDURE pro1(param1 ty1) IS
       v varchar2(1024);
       BEGIN
         DELETE FROM tbl1_v;
         FOR idx IN param1.first .. param1.last LOOP
           v := 'param1(' || idx || ')=' || param1(idx) || ';';
           INSERT INTO tbl1_v values(v);
         END LOOP;
       END;
       PROCEDURE pro1(param1 ty2) IS
       BEGIN
         DELETE FROM tbl1_v;
         FOR idx in param1.first .. param1.last LOOP
           v := 'param1(' || idx || ')=' || param1(idx) || ';';
           INSERT INTO tbl1_v values(v);
         END LOOP;
       END;
      PROCEDURE pro1_out(param1 out ty1) IS
      BEGIN
         param1 := ty1();
         param1.extend(10);
         FOR idx in 1..10 LOOP
          param1(idx) := idx;
         END LOOP;
       END;
      PROCEDURE pro1_out(param1 out ty2) IS
      BEGIN
         param1 := ty2();
         param1.extend(10);
         FOR idx in 1..10 LOOP
          param1(idx) := idx;
         END LOOP;
       END;
    PROCEDURE pro1_inout(param1 IN OUT ty1) IS BEGIN pro1(param1); pro1_out(param1); END;
    PROCEDURE pro1_inout(param1 IN OUT ty2) IS BEGIN pro1(param1); pro1_out(param1); END;
    END;
   /
   ```

   You can call the package from the local OceanBase database by executing the following statements:

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> CREATE TABLE tbl_local (c1 int);
   ```

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> INSERT INTO tbl_local VALUES(1);
   ```

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> DECLARE
       param pkg1.ty2@orcl_dblink;
     BEGIN
       SELECT C1 bulk collect INTO param FROM tbl_local;
       pkg1.pro1@orcl_dblink(param);
     END;
     /
   ```

   However, for a package named `pkg2` that is created by using the following statement:

   ```sql
   SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE pkg2 AS
       TYPE ty1 IS RECORD(c1 varchar2(10), c2 int);
       TYPE ty2 IS TABLE OF varchar2(10);
       TYPE ty3 IS TABLE OF ty1;
       TYPE ty4 IS TABLE OF varchar2(10) INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
       TYPE ty5 IS TABLE OF ty1 INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
       TYPE ty6 IS TABLE OF varchar2(10);
       PROCEDURE pro2(param1 ty1, param2 ty2, param3 ty3 , param4 ty4, param5 ty5);
   END;
   /
   ```

   Its body is as follows:

   ```sql
   SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY pkg2 AS
       PROCEDURE pro2 (param1 ty1, param2 ty2, param3 ty3 , param4 ty4, param5 ty5) IS
       BEGIN
           DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Parameter 1: ' || param1.c1 || ', ' || param1.c2);
           FOR i IN param2.FIRST .. param2.LAST LOOP
               DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Parameter 2(' || i || '): ' || param2(i));
           END LOOP;
           FOR i IN param3.FIRST .. param3.LAST LOOP
               DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Parameter 3(' || i || '): ' || param3(i).c1 || ', ' || param3(i).c2);
           END LOOP;
       END pro2;
   END pkg2;
   /
   ```

   If you call the `pkg2` package by using the following method, an error is returned:

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> DECLARE
       param1 pkg2.ty1@orcl_dblink;
       param2 pkg2.ty2@orcl_dblink;
       param3 pkg2.ty3@orcl_dblink;
       param4 pkg2.ty4@orcl_dblink;
       param5 pkg2.ty5@orcl_dblink;
     BEGIN
       param1.c1 := 'a';
       param1.c2 := 123;
       param2 := pkg2.ty2@orcl_dblink('b', 'c');
       param3 := pkg2.ty3@orcl_dblink();
       param3.EXTEND(2);
       param3(1).c1 := 'd';
       param3(1).c2 := 456;
       param3(2).c1 := 'e';
       param3(2).c2 := 789;

       pkg2.pro2@orcl_dblink(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5);
     END;
     /
   ```

   In addition, if the remote Oracle database is of version 12c or earlier, an error is returned when the `pkg2` package is called by using the following statement. This is because `ty6` does not appear in the routine parameters of the package.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> DECLARE
     v1 pkg2.ty6@orcl_dblink;
   BEGIN
     null;
   END;
   /
   ```

   For more information about how to use a package, see [Create a program package](../../../500.sql-reference/300.pl-reference/300.pl-oracle/900.package-oracle/200.create-a-package-oracle.md).

## Call a UDF in a remote database

Starting from OceanBase Database V4.2.2, you can call a UDF or package function in a remote Oracle database by using a DBLink. At present, you cannot call UDFs or package functions in a remote OceanBase database.

When you use a DBLink to call a UDF or package function in a remote Oracle database, take note of the following considerations:

* The following basic data types of inout parameters are supported in the call of a UDF:

   * String data types such as VARCHAR2, VARCHAR, and CHAR

   * Numeric data types such as NUMBER, INT, INTEGER, FLOAT, and DOUBLE

   * DATE

   * TIMESTAMP

* In the call of a package function, inout parameters of the following composite data types are supported:

   * [Record type](../../../500.sql-reference/300.pl-reference/300.pl-oracle/400.collections-and-records-oracle/800.record-oracle.md)

      The elements in a record must be of the following basic data types:

      * String data types such as VARCHAR2, VARCHAR, and CHAR

      * Numeric data types such as NUMBER, INT, INTEGER, FLOAT, and DOUBLE

      * DATE

      * TIMESTAMP

   However, if the remote Oracle database is of version 12c or earlier, the data types of parameters of a package must be any of the data types that appear in the routine parameters in the package. If the package type is defined only in the package but is not used in any routine parameters in the package, the package cannot be called.

   * [Nested table](../../../500.sql-reference/300.pl-reference/300.pl-oracle/400.collections-and-records-oracle/500.nested-table-oracle.md) and [associative array](../../../500.sql-reference/300.pl-reference/300.pl-oracle/400.collections-and-records-oracle/300.associative-array-oracle.md)

      The elements in a nested table or associative array must be of the record type or any of the following basic data types:

      * String data types such as VARCHAR2, VARCHAR, and CHAR

      * Numeric data types such as NUMBER, INT, INTEGER, FLOAT, and DOUBLE

      * DATE

      * TIMESTAMP

* You can call synonyms of UDFs or packages in a remote Oracle database, and call synonyms of remote UDFs or packages created in the local database.

Here are some examples: Assume that you have created, in the local OceanBase database, a DBLink named `orcl_link` to a remote Oracle database.

```sql
obclient [SYS]> CREATE DATABASE LINK orcl_dblink CONNECT TO orcl_user@oracle IDENTIFIED BY ****** OCI HOST 'xx.xx.xx.xx:1521/ORCL';
```

* Call a simple UDF.

   1. Create a UDF named `AddNumbers` in the remote Oracle database.

      ```sql
      SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION AddNumbers (num1 IN NUMBER, num2 IN NUMBER)
       RETURN NUMBER
       AS
       BEGIN
         RETURN num1 + num2;
       END;
       /
      ```

      The function supports two numbers as the input and returns the sum of the two numbers.

   2. Call this UDF in the local OceanBase database.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT AddNumbers@orcl_dblink(10, 20) AS Sum_Result FROM DUAL;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +------------+
      | SUM_RESULT |
      +------------+
      |         30 |
      +------------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   If you create a synonym for a UDF or package in the remote Oracle database, you can call the synonym in the local OceanBase database. Assume that you have created the following synonyms for the UDF `AddNumbers`:

   * Create a synonym named `syn_remote_AddNumbers` for the UDF `AddNumbers` in the remote Oracle database.

      ```sql
      SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE SYNONYM syn_remote_AddNumbers FOR AddNumbers;
      ```

   * Create a synonym named `syn_local_AddNumbers` for the UDF `AddNumbers` in the local OceanBase database by using a DBLink.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CREATE OR REPLACE SYNONYM syn_local_AddNumbers FOR AddNumbers@orcl_dblink;
      ```

   You can execute the following statements to call these synonyms in the local OceanBase database:

   * Call the synonym created in the remote Oracle database.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT syn_remote_AddNumbers@orcl_dblink(10, 20) AS Sum_Result FROM DUAL;
      ```

   * Call the synonym created in the local OceanBase database.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT syn_local_AddNumbers(10, 20) AS Sum_Result FROM DUAL;
      ```

* Call a package function.

   1. Create a package named `pac_employee_data` in the remote Oracle database, and define a function named `calculate_annual_bonus` in the package.

      ```sql
      SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE pac_employee_data AS
         -- Define the function prototype.
         FUNCTION calculate_annual_bonus(emp_id IN NUMBER, monthly_salary IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER;
       END pac_employee_data;
       /
      ```

      The corresponding package body is as follows:

      ```sql
      SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY pac_employee_data AS
         -- Implement the function.
         FUNCTION calculate_annual_bonus(emp_id IN NUMBER, monthly_salary IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
           annual_bonus NUMBER;
         BEGIN
           -- Assume that the annual bonus for an employee is 10% of the employee's annual salary.
           annual_bonus := monthly_salary * 12 * 0.1;
           RETURN annual_bonus;
         END calculate_annual_bonus;
       END pac_employee_data;
       /
      ```

   2. Call this package function in the local OceanBase database.

      You can remotely call the package function in a PL block by using the following statement:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
      ```

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> DECLARE
         emp_id CONSTANT NUMBER := 100;
         monthly_salary CONSTANT NUMBER := 5000;
         bonus_amount NUMBER;
       BEGIN
         -- Call the package function and obtain the result.
         bonus_amount := pac_employee_data.calculate_annual_bonus@orcl_dblink(emp_id, monthly_salary);

         DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee ID: ' || emp_id || ', Annual Bonus: $' || TO_CHAR(bonus_amount, '999,999.99'));
       END;
       /
      ```

      The return result is as follows:

      ```shell
      Employee ID: 100, Annual Bonus: $   6,000.00
      ```

      You can also call this package function by using the following SQL statement:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT pac_employee_data.calculate_annual_bonus@orcl_dblink(100, 5000) AS "Annual Bonus" FROM DUAL;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +--------------+
      | Annual Bonus |
      +--------------+
      |         6000 |
      +--------------+
      1 row in set
      ```
