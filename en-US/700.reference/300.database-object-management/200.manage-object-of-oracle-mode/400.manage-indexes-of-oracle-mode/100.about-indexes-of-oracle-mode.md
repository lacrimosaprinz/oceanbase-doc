# Overview

After you create a table, you can create an index on one or more columns in the table to speed up the execution of SQL statements on the table. Well-designed indexes can reduce physical or logical I/O operations.

Tables in OceanBase Database are clustered index tables. If you do not specify a primary key for a table, the system automatically generates a hidden primary key for the table.

The advantages, disadvantages, and considerations of indexes are as follows:

Advantages:

* With indexes, the data query speed is increased.

* With indexes, optimization hiders can be used during queries to improve the system performance.

Disadvantages:

* Index creation and maintenance are time-consuming, and the amount of time consumed increases as the data volume grows.

* When you add, delete, or modify data in tables, you must also dynamically maintain indexes, which slows down data maintenance.

Considerations:

* Create indexes on fields that are frequently used for queries, but do not create excess indexes on tables that are frequently updated.

* Do not use indexes for tables with a small data volume. This is because the time consumed in querying all data may be shorter than that in traversing the indexes. In this case, indexes may not be useful.

* Do not create indexes when the modification performance is far greater than the query performance.
