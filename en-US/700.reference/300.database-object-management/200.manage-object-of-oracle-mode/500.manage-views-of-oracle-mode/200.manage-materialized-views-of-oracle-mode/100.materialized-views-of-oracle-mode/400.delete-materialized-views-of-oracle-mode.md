# Drop a materialized view

This topic describes how to drop a materialized view by using SQL statements. 

## Required privileges

You need the `DROP TABLE` privilege to drop a materialized view. For more information about privileges in OceanBase Database, see [Privilege types in Oracle mode](../../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/000.permission-classification-of-oracle-mode.md). 

## Considerations

A materialized view that is separately dropped is not moved to the recycle bin. 

## Syntax

The syntax for dropping a materialized view is as follows:

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW [ schema. ] materialized_view;
```

**Parameters**

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| schema. | The schema where the materialized view is located. This parameter is optional. If you do not specify the `schema.` parameter, the system assumes by default that the materialized view resides in your own schema.  |
| materialized_view | The name of the materialized view.  |

## Example

Drop the materialized view named `mv_test_tbl1`. 

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_test_tbl1;
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
