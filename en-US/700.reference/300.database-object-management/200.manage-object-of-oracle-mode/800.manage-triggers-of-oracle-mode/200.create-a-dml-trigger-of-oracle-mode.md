# Create a DML trigger

You can create a DML trigger on a table or a view. A triggering event consists of the `DELETE`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` DML statements.

Unlike stored procedures and packages, a trigger has a separate namespace. Therefore, the name of a trigger can be identical to the name of a table or stored procedure. You must have the `CREATE TRIGGER` system privilege to create triggers.

## Create a row-level trigger

The current version of OceanBase Database supports the following types of row-level triggers:

* `BEFORE INSERT FOR EACH ROW`

* `AFTER INSERT FOR EACH ROW`

* `BEFORE UPDATE FOR EACH ROW`

* `AFTER UPDATE FOR EACH ROW`

* `BEFORE DELETE FOR EACH ROW`

* `AFTER DELETE FOR EACH ROW`

The syntax for creating a row-level trigger is as follows:

```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER }
{INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE [OF column [, column ...]]}
ON [schema.] table_name
[REFERENCING {OLD [AS] old | NEW [AS] new| PARENT as parent}]
FOR EACH ROW
[{ FOLLOWS | PRECEDES } other_trigger_name]
[WHEN condition]
BEGIN
...
END;
```

The following table describes the parameters in the syntax.

| **Parameter** | **Definition** | **Description** |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BEFORE` or `AFTER` | Specifies whether the trigger is activated before or after the triggering event.  | A BEFORE trigger is activated before the triggering event is executed. An AFTER trigger is activated after the triggering event is executed.  |
| `FOR EACH ROW` | Specifies the trigger as a row-level trigger.  | If a DML statement affects multiple rows of data in a table, the row-level trigger is activated for each row provided that the rows meet the trigger condition.  |
| `REFERENCING` | Specifies the correlation name. The correlation name can be used to reference the current new and old column values in the Procedural Language (PL) block and `WHEN` clause of the row-level trigger. The default correlation names are `OLD` and `NEW`.  | When you use the correlation names in the PL block of the trigger, you must add a colon (:) before them. In the `WHEN` clause, you must not add the colon (:).  |
| `WHEN` | Specifies the trigger condition.  | If the condition is a logical expression, it must contain the correlation name, and cannot contain a query statement or call a PL function. You can use the `WHEN` clause to specify a trigger condition only for row-level `BEFORE` and `AFTER` triggers.  |
| `FOLLOWS` or `PRECEDES` | Specifies the order of triggers.  | OceanBase Database allows you to associate multiple triggers of the same triggering event and activating time to the same table. By default, triggers with the same triggering event and activating time are activated in a random order. You can specify `FOLLOWS`, so that a new trigger is activated after the current trigger. At present, you can specify `PRECEDES`, which means that a new trigger is activated before the current trigger, but the configuration does not take effect.  |

<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>When an <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, or <code>DELETE</code> operation is performed on a base table, the corresponding stored procedure must be executed by the application. However, a trigger associated with the base table automatically is activated upon any DML operation on the table, which is irrelevant to the application, to ensure data consistency and integrity. </p>

### Limitations on row-level triggers

When you use row-level triggers, note that:

* The `SELECT` statement in a row-level trigger must use the `SELECT ... INTO ...` syntax, or be the `SELECT` statement used to define a cursor.

* You cannot use transaction control statements, such as `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`, in a row-level trigger.

* A stored procedure or function called by a row-level trigger cannot contain transaction control statements either.

### OLD and NEW pseudorecords

When a row-level trigger is executed, it may reference the values of a column before or after an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation.

* `:NEW` indicates the value of a column after an operation.

* `:OLD` indicates the value of a column before an operation.

The following table lists the validity of NEW and OLD records in different operations.

| **Feature** | **INSERT** | **UPDATE** | **DELETE** |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| **OLD** | NULL | Valid | Valid |
| **NEW** | Valid | Valid | NULL |

### Example

Create a simple row-level trigger.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE regions(
        region_id     NUMBER(5,0),  
        region_name  VARCHAR(50)
    );
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient>INSERT INTO regions VALUES(1,'Europe'),(4,'Middle East and Africa'),(3,'Asia'),
      (2,'Americas');
Query OK, 4 rows affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE reg_his AS SELECT * FROM regions WHERE 1=2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER del_new_region
      BEFORE DELETE ON regions
      FOR EACH ROW
      WHEN (old.region_id >3)
   BEGIN
      INSERT INTO reg_his(region_id , region_name )
           VALUES( :old.region_id, :old.region_name );
   END;
 /
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

In the preceding example, when data is dropped from the `regions` table, records with a `region_id` value greater than 3 are moved to the `reg_his` table.

```sql
obclient>SELECT * FROM regions;
+-----------+------------------------+
| REGION_ID | REGION_NAME            |
+-----------+------------------------+
|         1 | Europe                 |
|         4 | Middle East and Africa |
|         3 | Asia                   |
|         2 | Americas               |
+-----------+------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

obclient>SELECT * FROM reg_his;
Empty set

obclient> DELETE FROM regions WHERE region_id>2;
Query OK, 2 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM regions;
+-----------+-------------+
| REGION_ID | REGION_NAME |
+-----------+-------------+
|         1 | Europe      |
|         2 | Americas    |
+-----------+-------------+
2 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM reg_his;
+-----------+------------------------+
| REGION_ID | REGION_NAME            |
+-----------+------------------------+
|         4 | Middle East and Africa |
+-----------+------------------------+
1 row in set
```

## Create a statement-level trigger

A statement-level trigger is also a table-level trigger. A statement-level trigger is activated once when a specified statement is executed. In other words, the statement operation is a triggering event. If you create a statement-level trigger for a DML operation on a table, the system automatically executes the statement specified in the trigger when the DML operation is executed.

The syntax for creating a statement-level trigger is as follows:

```sql
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
{BEFORE | AFTER }
{INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE [OF column [, column ...]]}
ON [schema.] table_name
BEGIN
...
END;
```

### Limitations on statement-level triggers

* A statement-level trigger cannot access data before or after an operation by using the `OLD` or `NEW` keyword.

* A `WHEN` clause cannot be specified in a statement-level trigger.

### Example

Create a table to record the deleted data of a new table.

1. Create a table named `student` and a table named `old_student`, and then use the `old_student` table to record the deleted data of the `student` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE student(
   id  VARCHAR2(4) NOT NULL,
   name VARCHAR2(15) NOT NULL,
   age NUMBER(2)  NOT NULL,
   sex VARCHAR2(15) NOT NULL
   );
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> CREATE TABLE old_student AS SELECT * FROM student;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> INSERT INTO student VALUES('01','a',6,'Male'),('02','b',7,'Female');
   Query OK, 2 rows affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM student;
   +----+------+-----+--------+
   | ID | NAME | AGE | SEX    |
   +----+------+-----+--------+
   | 01 | a    |   6 | Male   |
   | 02 | b    |   7 | Female |
   +----+------+-----+--------+
   2 rows in set

   obclient> SELECT * FROM old_student;
   Empty set
   ```

2. Create a statement-level `TIG_OLD_STU` trigger.

   ```sql
   obclient> delimiter /

   obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER TIG_OLD_STU
   BEFORE DELETE ON student
   BEGIN
   INSERT INTO old_student SELECT * FROM student;
   END;
   /
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> delimiter;
   ```

3. Delete the data in the `student` table, and view the data of the two tables.

   ```sql
   obclient> DELETE student;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM student;
   Empty set

   obclient> SELECT * FROM old_student;
   +----+------+-----+--------+
   | ID | NAME | AGE | SEX    |
   +----+------+-----+--------+
   | 01 | a    |   6 | Male   |
   | 02 | b    |   7 | Female |
   +----+------+-----+--------+
   2 rows in set
   ```
