# Modify and drop a trigger

You can modify and drop a trigger by using Procedural Language (PL).

## Modify a trigger

To modify a trigger, you can use only the `REPLACE TRIGGER` statement. This statement is a DDL statement.

Generally, you can use the following syntax to create or modify a trigger:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trigger_name ...
```

If the value of `trigger_name` does not exist, the trigger is created. If the value of `trigger_name` exists, the trigger is modified.

## Drop a trigger

You can use the `DROP TRIGGER` statement to drop a trigger. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER trigger_name;
```

When you drop a table, the triggers created on the table are also dropped.
