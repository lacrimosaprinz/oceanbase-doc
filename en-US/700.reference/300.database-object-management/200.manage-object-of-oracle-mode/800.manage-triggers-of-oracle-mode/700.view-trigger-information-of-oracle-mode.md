# Query trigger information

You can query trigger information through related dictionary views. The trigger information includes the trigger name, type, and table that the trigger works on.

OceanBase Database provides the following dictionary views related to triggers:

* `USER_TRIGGERS`: displays the triggers owned by the current user.

* `DBA_TRIGGERS`: displays all triggers in the database.

* `ALL_TRIGGERS`: displays the triggers on tables owned by the current user. If you have the `CREATE ANY TRIGGER` privilege, this view also displays all the triggers in the database.

## Example 1

Query all triggers of the current user and detailed information about each trigger, including the type, status, the table to which the trigger applies, and the owner of the table.

```sql
obclient> SELECT TRIGGER_NAME,TRIGGER_TYPE,TRIGGERING_EVENT,TABLE_OWNER,TABLE_NAME,
               STATUS FROM USER_TRIGGERS;
+----------------+-----------------+------------------+-------------+------------+---------+
| TRIGGER_NAME   | TRIGGER_TYPE    | TRIGGERING_EVENT | TABLE_OWNER | TABLE_NAME | STATUS  |
+----------------+-----------------+------------------+-------------+------------+---------+
| DEL_NEW_REGION | BEFORE EACH ROW | DELETE           | SYS         | REGIONS    | ENABLED |
+----------------+-----------------+------------------+-------------+------------+---------+
1 row in set
```

## Example 2

View the definition of the `DEL_NEW_REGION` trigger.

```sql
obclient> SELECT TRIGGER_BODY FROM USER_TRIGGERS WHERE TRIGGER_NAME='DEL_NEW_REGION'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
TRIGGER_BODY: TRIGGER del_new_region
   BEFORE DELETE ON regions
   FOR EACH ROW
   WHEN (old.region_id >3)
BEGIN
   INSERT INTO reg_his(region_id , region_name )
       VALUES( :old.region_id, :old.region_name );
END
1 row in set
```

OceanBase Database also allows you to query trigger information through the `DBA_SOURCE`, `USER_SOURCE`, and `DBA_OBJECTS` views. Here is an example:

```sql
SELECT NAME FROM USER_SOURCE WHERE TYPE='TRIGGER' GROUP BY NAME;

SELECT NAME FROM DBA_SOURCE WHERE TYPE='TRIGGER';

SELECT OBJECT_NAME FROM DBA_OBJECTS WHERE OBJECT_TYPE='TRIGGER' AND OWNER='username';
```
