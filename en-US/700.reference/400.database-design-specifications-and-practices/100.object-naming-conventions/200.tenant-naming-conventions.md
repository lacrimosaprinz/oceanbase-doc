# Tenant naming conventions

Tenant is a unique object in OceanBase Database, which is similar to an instance in terms of architecture. This topic aims to provide developers with guidelines for standardizing the naming conventions for tenants.

## Tenant naming suggestions

* Name a tenant with no more than 64 bytes in lowercase.

* Use the name or abbreviation of the business unit as the name of the tenant. For example, the tenant name for the deposit business unit should be "deposit".

* If a subsystem of a business system requires an independent tenant, use the name or abbreviation of the business system along with letters, numbers, or underscores (_). For example, the tenant name for the account subsystem of the deposit business unit should be "deposit_account".
