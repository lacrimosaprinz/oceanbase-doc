# Comments

## Table comments

Adding comments to each field of a table helps to better understand the table and its fields through the create table statement. It also promotes collaborative development among developers and serves as a valuable supplement to the database design document by providing natural functional instructions.

You can add comments to a table by using two methods:

* Add comments to a table when you create the table.

  ```sql
  obclient> CREATE TABLE student(
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'Student No.',
  name VARCHAR(200) COMMENT 'Name',
  age INT COMMENT 'Age') COMMENT='Student information';
  ```

* After you create the table, use the `ALTER` statement to add comments.

  ```sql
  obclient> CREATE TABLE student( id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT , name VARCHAR(200) , age INT);
  obclient> ALTER TABLE student COMMENT 'Student information';
  obclient> ALTER TABLE student MODIFY COLUMN id INT COMMENT 'Student No.';
  obclient> ALTER TABLE student MODIFY COLUMN name VARCHAR(200) COMMENT 'Name';
  obclient> ALTER TABLE student MODIFY COLUMN age INT COMMENT 'Age';
  ```

   We recommend that you use the second method to add comments, that is, use the `ALTER` statement after the table is created. This method facilitates follow-up table maintenance.

## Comments in SQL statements

OceanBase Database allows you to add comments in general SQL statements by using one of the following three methods:

* Start the comment with a number sign (`#`) and end it with a line break. The comment text cannot extend to a new line.

* Start the comment with two hyphens (`--`) and end it with a line break. The comment text cannot extend to a new line.

* Start the comment with a slash and an asterisk (`/*`) and end it with an asterisk and a slash (`*/`). The comment text can span multiple lines.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>SQL statements do not support nested comments. </p>
  </main>

In particular, OceanBase Database can execute statements in `/*! */` as SQL statements. If a syntax error occurs in `/*!*/`, OceanBase Database processes it as a comment by default.

The comment format is as follows:

```sql
/*![Consecutive numeric characters representing the version]<Space><Any SQL statement>*/
```

Here are some examples:

* Create eight hash partitions for table `t1`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT) /*!50100
       PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 8*/;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

* You can use `ENABLE KEYS` to update non-unique indexes. During batch insertion, you can use `DISABLE KEYS` to postpone the update until all indexes are inserted.

   ```sql
   obclient> /*!ALTER TABLE t1 DISABLE KEYS */;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected


   obclient> /*!ALTER TABLE t1 ENABLE KEYS */;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

* The `DROP IF EXISTS` syntax of PL is supported.

   ```sql
   obclient> /*!50003 DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS */;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```
