# DELETE BACKUP POLICY

You can use the `ADD DELETE BACKUP POLICY` and `DROP DELETE BACKUP POLICY` statements to respectively set and drop a cleanup strategy.

To enable automatic cleanup for a tenant, you can use the `ADD DELETE BACKUP POLICY` statement to set a cleanup strategy for the tenant. Then, an automatic cleanup job is triggered every hour.

If you only want to cancel an ongoing cleanup job, you can execute the `CANCELE DELETE BACKUP` statement. For more information about the `CANCELE DELETE BACKUP` statement, see [CANCEL DELETE BACKUP](900.cancel-delete-backup.md). If you do not want a canceled cleanup job to be scheduled again, you must first execute the `DROP DELETE BACKUP POLICY` statement to drop the corresponding automatic cleanup strategy and then execute the `CANCELE DELETE BACKUP` statement to cancel the cleanup job.

## Limitations and considerations

* You can use the `ADD DELETE BACKUP POLICY` statement to set only a tenant-level automatic cleanup strategy, but not a cluster-level cleanup strategy.

* You can set or delete only one cleanup strategy for one tenant at a time.

* If all cleanup strategies of a tenant are dropped after you use the `DROP DELETE BACKUP POLICY` statement to drop a cleanup strategy for the tenant, automatic cleanup is disabled for the tenant.

* After you use the `DROP DELETE BACKUP POLICY` statement to drop a cleanup strategy, the ongoing cleanup jobs are not affected, but no cleanup jobs will be generated for the dropped cleanup strategy when the system schedules automatic cleanup next time.

## Required privileges

You must execute this statement as the `root` user of the `sys` tenant (namely `root@sys`) or as the administrator of a user tenant.  

* The default administrator is the `root` user in MySQL mode.
* The default administrator is the `SYS` user in Oracle mode.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM delete_backup_action [ TENANT [=] tenant_name ];

delete_backup_action:
      ADD DELETE BACKUP POLICY [=] policy_name [RECOVERY_WINDOW [=] recovery_window]
    | DROP DELETE BACKUP POLICY [=] policy_name
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tenant_name | The name of the tenant.  |
| POLICY | The name of the backup deletion strategy. Currently, this parameter can be set to `default` only, which indicates that only backups in `data_backup_dest` and `log_archive_dest` are automatically deleted.  |
| RECOVERY_WINDOW | Optional. The time window for restoring backup data. If you do not specify this parameter, the default restorable window is 0 days, which indicates that backup sets never expire and the system does not clean up backup data. For more information about this parameter, see [Backup cleanup parameter](../../../../../600.manage/600.backup-and-recovery/500.clear-backup-data/500.parameters-of-cleaning-up-backup.md).  |

## Examples

* sys tenant

   * Set a cleanup strategy named `default` for the `mysql_tenant` tenant from the sys tenant, and set the restorable window to 7 days.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM ADD DELETE BACKUP POLICY = 'default' RECOVERY_WINDOW ='7d' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

      Execute the following statement to query the cleanup strategies configured for the tenant:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_DELETE_POLICY WHERE TENANT_ID=1002;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-----------+-------------+-----------------+
      | TENANT_ID | POLICY_NAME | RECOVERY_WINDOW |
      +-----------+-------------+-----------------+
      |      1002 | default     | 7d              |
      +-----------+-------------+-----------------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   * Drop the `default` cleanup strategy for the `mysql_tenant` tenant from the sys tenant.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM DROP DELETE BACKUP POLICY 'default' TENANT mysql_tenant;
      ```

* User tenant

   * Set a cleanup strategy named `default` for the `oracle_tenant` tenant from the current tenant, and set the restorable window to 7 days.

      ```shell
      obclient [SYS]> ALTER SYSTEM ADD DELETE BACKUP POLICY 'default' RECOVERY_WINDOW '7d';
      ```

      Execute the following statement to query the cleanup strategies configured for the current tenant:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_BACKUP_DELETE_POLICY;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-------------+-----------------+
      | POLICY_NAME | RECOVERY_WINDOW |
      +-------------+-----------------+
      | default     | 7d              |
      +-------------+-----------------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   * Drop the `default` cleanup strategy for the `oracle_tenant` tenant from the current tenant.

      ```shell
      obclient [SYS]> ALTER SYSTEM DROP DELETE BACKUP POLICY 'default';
      ```
