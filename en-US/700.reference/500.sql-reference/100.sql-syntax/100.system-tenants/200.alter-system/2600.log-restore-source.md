# SET LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE

## Purpose

You can use the `ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE` statement to set a log restore source. OceanBase Database allows you to dynamically modify the log restore source. You can use this statement to set a log restore source for a standby tenant without one, or switch the log restore source of a standby tenant to another one.

The Physical Standby Database solution can be based on log archiving or network, depending on the deployment mode. In a log archiving-based Physical Standby Database scenario, a standby tenant obtains logs from the archive logs of the primary tenant or another standby tenant. In a network-based Physical Standby Database scenario, a standby tenant directly reads logs from the primary tenant or another standby tenant over the network.

After you create a standby tenant by using the BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG feature, you must use the `ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE` statement to set a log restore source for the standby tenant. Otherwise, you cannot enable continuous log synchronization for the standby tenant.

In a network-based Physical Standby Database scenario, if ARCHIVELOG is enabled for the primary tenant or source standby tenant, you can use the `ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE` statement to change the log restore source of a standby tenant to the archive logs of the primary tenant or source standby tenant.

In a log archiving-based Physical Standby Database scenario, if the network connection between the current standby tenant and the primary tenant or source standby tenant is normal, you can use the `ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE` statement to change the log restore source of the current standby tenant so that it directly reads logs over the network.

## Limitations and considerations

* In a scenario with cascaded standby databases, you can set the log restore source of the current standby tenant to the primary tenant or another standby tenant.

   Assume that primary tenant A and standby tenant B exist in the current environment. After you create standby tenant C, you can set the log restore source of standby tenant C to primary tenant A or standby tenant B.

* Before you change the log restore source of a standby tenant so that it directly reads logs over the network, you must create a dedicated user for accessing views for the current standby tenant in the primary tenant. For more information about how to create a dedicated user for accessing views, see the **Step 1: Create a dedicated user for accessing views** section in the [Create an empty standby tenant](../../../../../600.manage/400.high-availability/300.physical-standby-database-disaster-recovery/200.create-a-standby-tenant/200.create-an-empty-standby-tenant.md) topic.

* When you switch the log restore source of a standby tenant to another, you must make sure that the source tenant is consistent with the that specified when you created the standby tenant. In other words, the standby tenant can obtain logs from the archive logs of the source tenant or directly reads logs from the source tenant.

* In a standalone OceanBase database, the location of the system log stream of the primary tenant is the IP address and port number of the OBServer node.

## Required privileges

You must execute this statement as the `root` user of the `sys` tenant (namely `root@sys`) or as the administrator of a user tenant.  

* The default administrator is the `root` user in MySQL mode.
* The default administrator is the `SYS` user in Oracle mode.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE = { 'SERVICE=$host_ip_list USER=$user_name@$tenant_name PASSWORD=$password' | 'LOCATION=archive_path' } [ TENANT = standby_tenant_name ];
```

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>When you set the <code>SERVICE=$host_ip_list</code>, <code>USER=$user_name@$tenant_name</code>, and <code>PASSWORD=$password</code> parameters, they are separated with spaces and the system identifies them based on spaces. Therefore, do not leave spaces before and after the equal sign (=) that is used to join the parameter name and value. </p>
</main>

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| host_ip_list | The location of the system log stream of the primary tenant or source standby tenant if the log restore source is network-based online logs, namely, the IP address and SQL port number (2881 by default) of the OBServer node where the replica of the primary tenant or source standby tenant resides. Separate multiple IP addresses with semicolons (;). </br>In a network-based Physical Standby Database scenario, the location of the system log stream of the primary tenant or source standby tenant is the entrypoint for the standby tenant. You can query the `CDB_OB_ACCESS_POINT` view in the sys tenant or the `DBA_OB_ACCESS_POINT` view in a user tenant for the location of the system log stream of the primary tenant or source standby tenant. </br>After a log restore source is specified, the standby tenant detects location changes of the system log stream of the source tenant within seconds and automatically updates the internal settings accordingly. You do not need to manually update `LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE` during load balancing or disaster recovery of the primary tenant.  |
| user_name | The username of the dedicated user for accessing views that is created in the primary tenant. The user must have the read-only privilege on the following views in the sys tenant:<ul><li><code>GV$OB_LOG_STAT</code>: records information such as the list of servers, log sequence number (LSN) range of log streams for replicas, and replica roles (leader or follower). </li><li><code>GV$OB_UNITS</code>: records information about all units of a tenant, including the replica status, zone, region, and other information for filtering, obtaining, and maintaining server connections of the tenant. </li><li><code>GV$OB_PARAMETERS</code>: records the metadata necessary for services, such as<code>cluster_id</code>. </li><li><code>DBA_OB_ACCESS_POINT</code>: records information about the access portal. In scenarios such as migration and replication of the primary tenant and disaster recovery, if the access portal changes, the standby tenant can automatically detect the change. </li><li><code>DBA_OB_TENANTS</code>: records the compatibility mode of the primary tenant. </li><li><code>DBA_OB_LS</code>: records the log stream list of the primary tenant and the status of log streams. </li><li><code>DBA_OB_LS_HISTORY</code>: records the historical log streams created and deleted in the primary tenant. To use the <code>CREATE STANDBY TENANT</code> statement to create a standby tenant, make sure that no log stream has been deleted. </li></ul> |
| tenant_name | The name of the primary tenant to which the standby tenant connects over the network.  |
| password | The password of the dedicated user for accessing views.  |
| archive_path | The archive path of the log restore source if the standby tenant obtains logs from archive logs. You can query the `CDB_OB_ARCHIVE_DEST` view from the sys tenant or the `DBA_OB_ARCHIVE_DEST` view for a user tenant for the archive path of the primary tenant or source standby tenant.  |
| standby_tenant_name | The name of the standby tenant for which a log restore source is to be specified. When you set a log restore source for a standby tenant from the sys tenant of the cluster where the standby tenant resides, you must specify `TENANT = standby_tenant_name`.  |

## Examples

In a network-based Physical Standby Database scenario, perform the following steps to change the log restore source of a standby tenant to the archive logs of the primary tenant:

1. Query the archive path of the primary tenant.

   * Query the archive path of the primary tenant from the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the primary tenant resides

      Here is a sample statement:

      ```sql
      obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_ARCHIVE_DEST WHERE tenant_id= 1002;
      ```

   * Query the archive path of the primary tenant from the current tenant

      :::tab
      tab MySQL mode

      Here is a sample statement:

      ```sql
      obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_ARCHIVE_DEST;
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      Here is a sample statement:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_ARCHIVE_DEST;
      ```

      :::

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +---------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   | DEST_NO | NAME                  | VALUE                           |
   +---------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   |       0 | binding               | OPTIONAL                        |
   |       0 | dest_id               | 1002                            |
   |       0 | path                  | file:///data/1/example_archive  |
   |       0 | piece_switch_interval | 1d                              |
   |       0 | state                 | ENBALE                          |
   +---------+-----------------------+---------------------------------+
   5 rows in set
   ```

   The value of `path` in the `NAME` column is the log archive path of the current tenant.

2. Change the log restore source.

   * Change the log restore source of the standby tenant `standby_tenant1` from the sys tenant of the cluster where the standby tenant resides

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE='LOCATION=file:///data/1/example_archive' TENANT = standby_tenant1;
      ```

   * Change the log restore source of the standby tenant `standby_tenant1` from the current tenant

      ```shell
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE='LOCATION=file:///data/1/example_archive';
      ```

In a log archiving-based Physical Standby Database scenario, perform the following steps to change the log restore source of the standby tenant `standby_tenant2` so that the standby tenant directly reads logs over the network:

1. Query the location of the system log stream of the primary tenant `primary_tenant`.

   * Query the location of the system log stream of the primary tenant from the sys tenant of the cluster where the primary tenant resides

      Here is a sample statement:

      ```sql
      obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_ACCESS_POINT WHERE tenant_name='primary_tenant';
      ```

   * Query the location of the system log stream of the primary tenant from the current tenant

      :::tab
      tab MySQL mode

      Here is a sample statement:

      ```sql
      obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_ACCESS_POINT;
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      Here is a sample statement:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_ACCESS_POINT;
      ```

      :::

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-----------+----------------+-------------+----------+
   | TENANT_ID | TENANT_NAME    | SVR_IP      | SQL_PORT |
   +-----------+----------------+-------------+----------+
   |      1004 | primary_tenant | 11.xx.xx.22 |    17855 |
   |      1004 | primary_tenant | 11.xx.xx.23 |    17857 |
   |      1004 | primary_tenant | 11.xx.xx.24 |    17859 |
   +-----------+----------------+-------------+----------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

   The number of rows in the return result varies with the number of replicas of the tenant. In this example, the primary tenant has three replicas. If the primary tenant or source standby tenant has only one replica, only one row is returned.

2. Change the log restore source.

   * Change the log restore source of a standby tenant from the sys tenant of the cluster where the standby tenant resides

      ```sql
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE = 'SERVICE=11.xx.xx.22:17855;11.xx.xx.23:17857;11.xx.xx.24:17859 USER=rep_user@primary_tenant PASSWORD=******' TENANT = standby_tenant2;
      ```

   * Change the log restore source of a standby tenant from the current tenant

      ```sql
      obclient > ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE = 'SERVICE=11.xx.xx.22:17855;11.xx.xx.23:17857;11.xx.xx.24:17859 USER=rep_user@primary_tenant PASSWORD=******';
      ```
