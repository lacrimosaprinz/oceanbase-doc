# RECOVER STANDBY

## Purpose

After a physical restore is completed or a physical standby database is created, you can use the `ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY` statement to specify a log restore end point for the standby tenant so that the standby tenant replays partial logs or continuously replays logs.

## Required privileges

You must execute this statement as the `root` user of the `sys` tenant (namely `root@sys`) or as the administrator of a user tenant.  

* The default administrator is the `root` user in MySQL mode.
* The default administrator is the `SYS` user in Oracle mode.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY
    [TENANT [=] tenant_name] UNTIL { TIME='timestamp' | SCN=scn_no | UNLIMITED };
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tenant_name | The standby tenant for which logs are to be restored when you execute this statement in the sys tenant. You can specify only one standby tenant. To restore logs for multiple tenants, execute this statement repeatedly. <main id="notice" type='notice'> <h4>Notice</h4> <p>You must use the <code>TENANT = tenant_name</code> clause to specify the target tenant only when you execute this statement in the sys tenant. When you execute this statement in a user tenant, you cannot use the <code>TENANT = tenant_name</code> clause. </p></main> |
| timestamp | The timestamp to which logs can be restored for the standby tenant. `TIME` and its value must be joined by using an equal sign (`=`).  |
| scn_no | The system change number (SCN) to which logs can be restored for the standby tenant. `SCN` and its value must be joined by using an equal sign (`=`).  |
| UNLIMITED | Indicates unlimited restore. In this case, the standby tenant can continuously replay archive logs of the source tenant. In a Physical Standby Database scenario, this parameter indicates that the standby tenant is in continuous synchronization mode.  |

## Examples

* sys tenant

   * In a backup and restore scenario, execute the following statement in the sys tenant to replay logs to the timestamp `'2023-06-01 00:00:00'` for the standby tenant `restore_oracle_tenant`:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY TENANT restore_oracle_tenant UNTIL TIME='2023-06-01 00:00:00';
      ```

   * In a Physical Standby Database scenario, execute the following statement in the sys tenant to enable the continuous synchronization mode for the standby tenant `restore_oracle_tenant`:

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY TENANT restore_oracle_tenant UNTIL UNLIMITED;
      ```

* User tenant

   * In a backup and restore scenario, execute the following statement in the standby tenant `restore_oracle_tenant` to replay logs to the timestamp `'2023-06-01 00:00:00'` for the current tenant:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY UNTIL TIME='2023-06-01 00:00:00';
      ```

   * In a Physical Standby Database scenario, execute the following statement in the standby tenant `restore_oracle_tenant` to enable the continuous synchronization mode for the current tenant:

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY UNTIL UNLIMITED;
      ```
