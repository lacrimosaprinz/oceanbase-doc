# SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST

## Purpose

You can use this statement to configure a backup destination for a user tenant. The backup destination is a data backup path.

The `sys` tenant and meta tenants do not support backup and restore. You do not need to configure backup destinations for them.

## Required privileges

Only the `root` user of the `sys` tenant (`root@sys`) or the administrator user of a user tenant can execute this statement.  

* The default administrator user in MySQL mode is `root`.
* The default administrator user in Oracle mode is `SYS`.

## Syntax

```shell
ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'data_backup_path' [TENANT = tenant_name];
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| data_backup_path | The data backup path. OceanBase Database allows you to use Network File System (NFS), Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS), Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS), and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) as the backup media. Examples of `data_backup_path` are provided below. </br>When you use OSS, COS, or S3 as the backup media, you can set the `delete_mode` parameter to configure the cleanup mode for backup files. Append the `delete_mode` parameter to the backup path by using an ampersand (`&`). The `delete_mode` parameter has two values:<ul><li>`delete`: In this mode, the system directly deletes the backup files that meet the cleanup requirements. </li> <li>`tagging`: In this mode, the system tags the backup files that meet the cleanup requirements, and the backup files are still retained. </li></ul> |
| tenant_name | The name of the tenant for which you want to configure a backup destination. This parameter is used in the `sys` tenant. <main id="notice" type='notice'> <h4>Notice</h4><p>When you execute this statement in the `sys` tenant, you must specify the <code>TENANT tenant_name</code> clause. When you execute this statement in a user tenant, it takes effect only on the current tenant, and therefore you do not specify this clause. </p></main> |

The following examples show how to configure data backup destinations in OceanBase Database when NFS, OSS, COS, and S3 are used as the backup media.

### Parameter examples

#### Example of data_backup_path for NFS backup

```shell
ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'nfs://your-nfs-server/your-backup-path' [TENANT = your-tenant-name];
```

`data_backup_path` consists of the following parts:

- `nfs://your-nfs-server/your-backup-path`: the path of the NFS server accessible to OceanBase Database, which stores data backups.

#### Example of data_backup_path for OSS backup

```shell
ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'oss://your-bucket-name/your-archive-path?host=oss-your-region.aliyuncs.com&access_id=your-access-id&access_key=your-access-key' [TENANT = your-tenant-name];
```

`data_backup_path` consists of the following parts:

- `oss://your-oss-bucket-name/your-backup-path`: the name of the OSS bucket and the backup path, which stores data backups.
- `host=oss-your-region.aliyuncs.com`: the domain name used to access OSS. `your-region` must be replaced with the actual OSS region code.
- `access_id=your-access-id` and `access_key=your-access-key`: the AccessKey ID and AccessKey secret used for authentication.

#### Example of data_backup_path for COS backup

```shell
ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'cos://your-bucket-name/your-archive-path?host=cos.your-region.myqcloud.com&access_id=your-access-id&access_key=your-access-key&appid=your-appid' [TENANT = your-tenant-name];
```

`data_backup_path` consists of the following parts:

- `cos://your-cos-bucket-name/your-backup-path`: the name of the COS bucket and the backup path, which stores data backups.
- `host=cos.your-region.myqcloud.com`: the domain name used to access COS. `your-region` must be replaced with the actual COS region code.
- `access_id=your-access-id` and `access_key=your-access-key`: the AccessKey ID and AccessKey secret used for authentication.
- `appid=your-appid`: the AppID of your Tencent Cloud account.

#### Example of data_backup_path for S3 backup

```shell
ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 's3://your-bucket-name/your-archive-path?host=s3.your-region.amazonaws.com&access_id=your-access-id&access_key=your-access-key&s3_region=your-s3-region' [TENANT = your-tenant-name];
```

`data_backup_path` consists of the following parts:

- `s3://your-s3-bucket-name/your-backup-path`: the name of the S3 bucket and the backup path, which stores data backups.
- `host=s3.your-region.amazonaws.com`: the domain name used to access S3. `your-region` must be replaced with the actual AWS region code.
- `access_id=your-access-id` and `access_key=your-access-key`: the AccessKey ID and AccessKey secret for AWS.
- `s3_region=your-s3-region`: the region where the S3 bucket is deployed.


## Examples

* `sys` tenant

   * In the `sys` tenant, configure a backup destination for the `mysql_tenant` tenant. Specifically, set the destination path to an NFS path.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'file:///data/nfs/backup/data' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

   * In the `sys` tenant, configure a backup destination for the `mysql_tenant` tenant. Specifically, set the destination path to an OSS path and the cleanup mode for backup files to `delete`.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/?host=xxx.aliyun-inc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&delete_mode=delete' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

   * In the `sys` tenant, configure a backup destination for the `mysql_tenant` tenant. Specifically, set the destination path to a COS path and the cleanup mode for backup files to `delete`.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'cos://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/?host=cos.ap-xxx.myqcloud.com/&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&appid=xxx&delete_mode=delete' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

      Here, `appid` indicates the AppID of your Tencent Cloud account.

   * In the `sys` tenant, configure a backup destination for the `mysql_tenant` tenant. Specifically, set the destination path to an S3 path and the cleanup mode for backup files to `tagging`.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST='s3://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/data?host=s3.<region>.amazonaws.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&s3_region=xxx&delete_mode=tagging' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

      Here, `s3_region` indicates the region where the S3 bucket is deployed.

* User tenant

   * In the `mysql_tenant` tenant, configure a backup destination for the current tenant. Specifically, set the destination path to an NFS path.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'file:///data/nfs/backup/data';
      ```

   * In the `mysql_tenant` tenant, configure a backup destination for the current tenant. Specifically, set the destination path to an OSS path and the cleanup mode for backup files to `delete`.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/?host=xxx.aliyun-inc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&delete_mode=delete';
      ```

   * In the `oracle_tenant` tenant, configure a backup destination for the current tenant. Specifically, set the destination path to a COS path and the cleanup mode for backup files to `delete`.

      ```shell
      obclient [SYS]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'cos://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/?host=cos.ap-xxx.myqcloud.com/&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&appid=xxx&delete_mode=delete';
      ```

      Here, `appid` indicates the AppID of your Tencent Cloud account.

   * In the `mysql_tenant` tenant, configure a backup destination for the current tenant. Specifically, set the destination path to an S3 path and the cleanup mode for backup files to `tagging`.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST='s3://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/data?host=s3.<region>.amazonaws.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&s3_region=xxx&delete_mode=tagging';
