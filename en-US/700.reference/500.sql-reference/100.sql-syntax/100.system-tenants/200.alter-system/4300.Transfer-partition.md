# TRANSFER PARTITION

## Purpose

You can use the `ALTER SYSTEM TRANSFER PARTITION` statement to transfer the specified partition to the specified log stream.

## Required privileges

To execute the `ALTER SYSTEM TRANSFER PARTITION` statement, you must have the `ALTER SYSTEM` privilege. For more information about the privileges in OceanBase Database, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md) and [Privilege types in Oracle mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/000.permission-classification-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID [=] $table_id, OBJECT_ID [=] $object_id TO LS $ls_id [tenant = '$tenant_name']
```

## Limitations and considerations

* You can perform partition transfer only in the primary tenant, and the partition to be transferred must be under a user tenant.

* If you disable partition transfer for a tenant by setting `enable_transfer` to `false`, an error is returned when you execute the `TRANSFER PARTITION` statement on the tenant, and partition transfer tasks for `TRANSFER PARTITION` statements that have been executed successfully may be canceled.

* Partition transfer is not supported for system tables.

* Partition transfer is not supported for user tables in the `sys` tenant.

* A regular table cannot be transferred to a broadcast log stream, nor a replicated table to a regular log stream.

* Dependent partitions, such as partitions of local index tables and LOB tables, cannot be transferred.

* Before a transfer operation is completed on one partition, you cannot initiate another transfer on the partition.

* If a load balancing job (BALANCE_JOB) is being processed in the current cluster, manually triggered partition transfer tasks will not be immediately scheduled.



## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------------|------------------------|
| $table_id | The ID of the partitioned table from which you want to transfer a partition.  |
| $object_id | The ID of the partition to be transferred, which is an integer.  |
| $ls_id | The ID of the destination log stream for partition transfer.  |
| $tenant_name | The name of the tenant to which the partition to be transferred belongs. This parameter is used in the `sys` tenant.  |

## Examples
1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding parameters in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

2. Query the ID of the target tenant from the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TENANT_ID FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS WHERE TENANT_NAME = 'oracle_tenant';
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-----------+
   | TENANT_ID |
   +-----------+
   |      1006 |
   +-----------+
   1 row in set
   ```

3. Query partition information.

   Query the `CDB_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS` view for the values of `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` of the specified partition.

   * Obtain the values of `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` of a non-partitioned table.

      Assume that the `oracle_tenant` tenant has a non-partitioned table named `T1`. Here is a query example:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 AND DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'T1' LIMIT 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500002 |    500002 |    200001 |  1001 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   * Obtain the values of `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` of a partition.

      You need to specify only the partition name in the query.

      Assume that the `oracle_tenant` tenant has a partitioned table named `TBL1_LOG_R` that is defined as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CREATE TABLE tbl1_log_r(log_id INT,log_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT SYSDATE)
       PARTITION BY RANGE(log_date)
        (PARTITION M202001 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/02/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202002 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/03/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202003 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/04/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202004 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/05/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202005 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/06/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202006 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/07/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202007 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/08/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202008 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/09/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202009 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/10/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202010 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/11/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202011 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/12/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202012 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2021/01/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION MMAX VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
         );
      ```

      The following example shows how to query the aforementioned information about the `M202005` partition of the partitioned table:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 AND DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'TBL1_LOG_R' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'M202005' LIMIT 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500003 |    500009 |    200006 |  1002 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   * Obtain the values of `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` of a subpartition.

      You need to specify both the partition name and subpartition name in the query.

      Assume that the `oracle_tenant` tenant has a subpartitioned table named `T2_F_RL` that is defined as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CREATE TABLE t2_f_rl(col1 INT,col2 VARCHAR2(50))
       PARTITION BY RANGE(col1)
       SUBPARTITION BY LIST(col2)
       (PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN(100)
         (SUBPARTITION sp0 VALUES('01'),
          SUBPARTITION sp1 VALUES('02')
          ),
        PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN(200)
         (SUBPARTITION sp2 VALUES('01'),
          SUBPARTITION sp3 VALUES('02'),
          SUBPARTITION sp4 VALUES('03')
         )
        );
      ```

      The following example shows how to query the aforementioned information about the `SP2` subpartition of the subpartitioned table:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 AND DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'T2_F_RL' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'P1' AND SUBPARTITION_NAME = 'SP2' LIMIT 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500018 |    500023 |    200017 |  1003 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

4. Select the transfer destination.

   1. Query the `CDB_OB_LS` view for the log stream status and information in the tenant.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_LS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      | TENANT_ID | LS_ID | STATUS | PRIMARY_ZONE | UNIT_GROUP_ID | LS_GROUP_ID | CREATE_SCN          | DROP_SCN | SYNC_SCN            | READABLE_SCN        | FLAG |
      +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      |      1006 |     1 | NORMAL | zone1        |             0 |           0 |                NULL |     NULL | 1701244663685197789 | 1701244663685197789 |      |
      |      1006 |  1001 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1006 |        1001 | 1701239786827662637 |     NULL | 1701244663685197789 | 1701244663685197789 |      |
      |      1006 |  1002 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1007 |        1002 | 1701239786831568305 |     NULL | 1701244664066906860 | 1701244664066906859 |      |
      |      1006 |  1003 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1008 |        1003 | 1701239786834300282 |     NULL | 1701244664175263949 | 1701244664175263948 |      |
      +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      4 rows in set
      ```

   2. Query the `CDB_OB_TABLET_TO_LS` view for tablet distribution on log streams.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT LS_ID, COUNT(*) AS C FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLET_TO_LS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 GROUP BY LS_ID;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-------+------+
      | LS_ID | C    |
      +-------+------+
      |     1 |  578 |
      |  1001 |    7 |
      |  1002 |    5 |
      |  1003 |    7 |
      +-------+------+
      4 rows in set
      ```

      Based on the preceding information, select an appropriate log stream as the transfer destination.

5. Execute the following statement to transfer a partition:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID [=] table_id, OBJECT_ID [=] object_id TO LS ls_id TENANT = 'tenant_name';
   ```

   The parameters are described as follows:

   * `table_id`: the table ID.

   * `object_id`: the partition ID.

   * `ls_id`: the ID of the destination log stream for partition transfer.

   * `tenant_name`: the tenant to which the partition to be transferred belongs.

   The following example transfers the `M202005` partition of the `TBL1_LOG_R` table in the `SYS` database of the `oracle_tenant` tenant from the current `1002` log stream to the `1003` log stream.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID = 500003, OBJECT_ID = 500009 TO LS 1003 TENANT = 'oracle_tenant';
   ```

6. After the partition transfer statement is executed successfully, you can query the task status in the following views.

   1. Query the `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view to obtain the values of `TASK_ID`, `TRANSFER_TASK_ID`, and `BALANCE_JOB_ID` of the task.

      The `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view shows the partition transfer tasks that are being processed on all tenants. Here is a query example:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TASK_ID, BALANCE_JOB_ID, TRANSFER_TASK_ID, STATUS FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 AND TABLE_ID = 500003 AND OBJECT_ID = 500009;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
      | TASK_ID | BALANCE_JOB_ID | TRANSFER_TASK_ID | STATUS |
      +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
      |       1 |          17304 |                1 | DOING  |
      +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
      1 row in set
      ```

      You can check the `STATUS` column in the query result to confirm the task status and further view the task execution progress. The column has the following valid values:

      * `WAITING`: The task is waiting to be executed and has not been scheduled.
      * `INIT`: A `BALANCE_JOB` job has been constructed for the task. You can view the execution progress of the `BALANCE_JOB` job based on its `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value.
      * `DOING`: The transfer has already been started. You can query partition transfer tasks by `TRANSFER_TASK_ID`. The value of `TRANSFER_TASK_ID` changes many times, because a partition transfer task involves multiple transfers.

      If the query of the `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view returns an empty result, you can query the task result in the `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view.

   2. Query the `CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOBS` or `CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY` view for the execution status of the associated `BALANCE_JOB` job based on the obtained `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value.

      The `CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOBS` view shows the load balancing jobs that are being performed on all tenants. Each tenant has only one ongoing load balancing job (BALANCE_JOB) at a time, and each job generates multiple load balancing tasks (TRANSFER_TASK). The `CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY` view shows the history of load balancing jobs that have been performed on all tenants. Here are some query examples:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOBS WHERE JOB_ID = 17304;
      ```

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY WHERE JOB_ID = 17304;
      ```

      Replace `17304` with the previously obtained `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value.

      In the query result, the `STATUS` column shows the execution status of the `BALANCE_JOB` job. Valid values of the column are as follows:

      * `DOING`: The load balancing job is being performed.
      * `COMPLETED`: The load balancing job is successfully executed.
      * `CANCELING`: The load balancing job is being canceled.
      * `CANCELED`: The load balancing job is canceled.

   3. Query the `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS` or `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY` view for the execution status of the associated `TRANSFER_TASK` task based on the obtained `TRANSFER_TASK_ID` value.

      The `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS` view shows the load balancing tasks that are being performed on all tenants. Multiple load balancing tasks may be running at the same time. These tasks (TRANSFER_TASK) belong to the same load balancing job (BALANCE_JOB). The `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY` view shows the history of load balancing tasks that have been performed on all tenants. Here are some query examples:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
      ```

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
      ```

      Replace `1` with the previously obtained `TRANSFER_TASK_ID` value.

      In the query result, the `STATUS` column shows the execution status of the `TRANSFER_TASK` task. Valid values of the column are as follows:

      * `INIT`: The transfer task is being created.
      * `START`: The transfer task execution starts.
      * `DOING`: The transfer task is being executed.
      * `ABORTED`: The transfer task failed to execute and the task is terminated.
      * `COMPLETED`: The transfer task is successfully executed.
      * `FAILED`: The transfer task failed to execute.
      * `CANCELED`: The transfer task is canceled.

4. Query the `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view for the result of the partition transfer task based on the obtained `TASK_ID` value.

   The `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view shows the history of partition transfer tasks that have been performed on all tenants.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
   ```

   Replace `1` with the previously obtained `TASK_ID` value.

   In the query result, the `STATUS` column shows the result of the partition transfer task. Valid values of the column are as follows:

   * `COMPLETED`: The partition transfer task is successfully executed.

   * `FAILED`: The partition transfer task failed to execute. You can further check the cause of the failure based on the value in the `COMMENT` column.

7. After the partition transfer task is successfully executed, query information about the transferred partition again.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 AND DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'TBL1_LOG_R' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'M202005' LIMIT 1;
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   |   500003 |    500009 |    200006 |  1003 |
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   The query result shows that the `M202005` partition of the `TBL1_LOG_R` table in the `SYS` database has been transferred from the `1002` log stream to the `1003` log stream. The partition transfer operation succeeded.
