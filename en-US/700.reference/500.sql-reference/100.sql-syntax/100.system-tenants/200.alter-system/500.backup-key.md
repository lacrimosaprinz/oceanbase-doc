# BACKUP KEY

## Purpose

If transparent encryption is configured for the source tenant before data backup, you must use the `ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP KEY` statement to back up the key for the source tenant.

## Limitations and considerations

If key rotation is triggered for the source tenant after you back up the key, you must back up the key of the source tenant again before you restore the data.

## Required privileges

You must execute this statement as the `root` user of the `sys` tenant (namely `root@sys`) or as the administrator of a user tenant.  

* The default administrator is the `root` user in MySQL mode.
* The default administrator is the `SYS` user in Oracle mode.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP KEY [TENANT [=] {tenant_name[, tenant_name]...}] TO 'backup_key_path' [ENCRYPTED BY 'password'];
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tenant_name | The name of the tenant for which the key is to be backed up from the sys tenant. You can specify multiple tenant names separated with commas (,). If you do not specify this parameter, keys of all user tenants in the current cluster are backed up. <main id="notice" type='notice'> <h4>Notice</h4><p>You must use the <code>TENANT = tenant_name</code> clause to specify the target tenant only when you execute this statement in the sys tenant. When you execute this statement in a user tenant, you cannot use the <code>TENANT = tenant_name</code> clause. </p></main> |
| backup_key_path | The path where the key is to be backed up. This path is user-defined and cannot be the same as the data backup path or log archive path.  |
| password | The encryption password for the key backup path. By default, if you do not specify this parameter, the key backup path will not be encrypted.  |

## Examples


* Execute the following statement in the sys tenant to back up the key of the `mysql_tenant` tenant to the `file:///data_backup_dest/key` path, and set an encryption password for the key backup path.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP KEY TENANT = mysql_tenant TO 'file:///data_backup_dest/key' ENCRYPTED BY '******';
   ```

* Execute the following statement in the `mysql_tenant` tenant to back up the key of the current tenant to the `file:///data_backup_dest/key` path.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP KEY TO 'file:///data_backup_dest/key';
   ```
