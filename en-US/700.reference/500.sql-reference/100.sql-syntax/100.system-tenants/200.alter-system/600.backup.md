# BACKUP

You can use this statement to initiate a data backup. OceanBase Database supports full backup and incremental backup.

A full backup backs up all macroblocks. An incremental backup backs up all macroblocks generated and modified since the last full backup.

## Limitations and considerations

* Before you initiate a data backup, make sure that the archive mode is enabled and `STATUS` of the log archive job is `DOING`.

   For more information about how to view the status of a log archive job, see [View the archiving progress](../../../../../600.manage/600.backup-and-recovery/300.log-archive/600.view-log-archive-progress.md).

   For more information about the syntax for enabling the archive mode, see [ARCHIVELOG](200.archivelog.md).

* Make sure that a full backup has been performed. If you initiate an incremental backup when no full backup is available, the system converts the incremental backup to a full backup by default.

* If you directly initiate an incremental backup without performing a full backup after you upgrade a cluster to a later version (the current version), the system converts the incremental backup to a full backup by default, even if a full backup has been performed for the tenant in the earlier version.

## Required privileges

Only the `root` user of the `sys` tenant (`root@sys`) or the administrator user of a user tenant can execute this statement. 

* The default administrator user in MySQL mode is `root`.
* The default administrator user in Oracle mode is `SYS`.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM backup_action [DESCRIPTION [=] 'description'];

backup_option:
      BACKUP DATABASE [PLUS ARCHIVELOG]
    | BACKUP TENANT [=] {tenant_name[, tenant_name]...} [PLUS ARCHIVELOG]
    | BACKUP INCREMENTAL DATABASE
    | BACKUP INCREMENTAL TENANT [=] {tenant_name[, tenant_name]...}

```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PLUS ARCHIVELOG | If you specify the `PLUS ARCHIVELOG` keyword, the archive logs are also backed up during data backup, and a complete data set with archive logs will be generated in the backup directory. You can use this data set to restore the tenant data to the latest SCN that supports restore specified by `MIN_RESTORE_SCN`.  |
| tenant_name | The name of the tenant to be backed up. This parameter is used in the `sys` tenant. If you specify multiple tenants, separate the tenant names with commas (,). If you want to specify all user tenants, you must execute the `ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP [INCREMENTAL] DATABASE` statement in the `sys` tenant. <main id="notice" type='notice'> <h4>Notice</h4><p>When you execute this statement in the `sys` tenant, you must specify the <code>TENANT = tenant_name</code> clause. When you execute this statement in a user tenant, it takes effect only on the current tenant, and therefore you do not need to specify this clause. </p></main> |
| INCREMENTAL | Indicates an incremental backup.  |
| description | The description of the operation. This parameter is optional.  |

## Examples

Assume that the current cluster contains three tenants: `sys`, `mysql_tenant`, and `oracle_tenant`, and that backup preparations have been completed for the `mysql_tenant` and `oracle_tenant` tenants.

* `sys` tenant

   * In the `sys` tenant, initiate a full data backup for all user tenants in the cluster.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP DATABASE;
      ```

      After the statement is executed, the system initiates a full data backup for the `mysql_tenant` and `oracle_tenant` tenants.

   * In the `sys` tenant, initiate a full data backup for the `mysql_tenant` tenant.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

   * In the `sys` tenant, initiate a full data backup that also backs up archive logs for the `mysql_tenant` tenant.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP TENANT = mysql_tenant PLUS ARCHIVELOG;
      ```

      After the statement is executed, the system generates a complete data set with archive logs in the data backup path of the tenant. If you use OceanBase Database Community Edition or OceanBase Database in standalone mode, you can use this data set to create a standby tenant in the Physical Standby Database scenario. For more information, see [Create a standby tenant by using the BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG feature](../../../../../600.manage/400.high-availability/300.physical-standby-database-disaster-recovery/200.create-a-standby-tenant/400.create-a-standby-tenant-by-backup-database-plus-archivelog.md).

   * In the `sys` tenant, initiate an incremental data backup for all user tenants in the cluster.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP INCREMENTAL DATABASE;
      ```

      After the statement is executed, the system initiates an incremental data backup for the `mysql_tenant` and `oracle_tenant` tenants.

   * In the `sys` tenant, initiate an incremental data backup for the `mysql_tenant` tenant.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP INCREMENTAL TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

* User tenant

   * In the `mysql_tenant` tenant, initiate a full data backup for the current tenant.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP DATABASE;
      ```

   * In the `oracle_tenant` tenant, initiate a full data backup that also backs up archive logs for the current tenant.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG;
      ```

   * In the `mysql_tenant` tenant, initiate an incremental data backup for the current tenant.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP INCREMENTAL DATABASE;
      ```
