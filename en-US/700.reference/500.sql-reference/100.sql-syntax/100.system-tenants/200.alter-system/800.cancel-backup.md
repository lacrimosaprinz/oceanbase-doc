# CANCEL BACKUP

## Purpose

You can use the `ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL BACKUP` statement to stop ongoing backup jobs.

## Limitations and considerations

After you use the `ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL BACKUP` statement to stop ongoing backup jobs for a tenant, the system will generate incomplete backup data. We recommend that you enable automatic backup cleanup for the tenant in advance to clean up incomplete backups in a timely manner to release resources occupied by them. For the statement used to enable automatic backup cleanup, see [DELETE BACKUP](1600.delete-backup.md).

## Required privileges

You must execute this statement as the `root` user of the `sys` tenant (namely `root@sys`) or as the administrator of a user tenant.  

* The default administrator is the `root` user in MySQL mode.
* The default administrator is the `SYS` user in Oracle mode.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL BACKUP [TENANT [=] {tenant_name[, tenant_name]...}];
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tenant_name | The name of the tenant for which ongoing backup jobs are to be stopped when you execute this statement in the sys tenant. You can specify multiple tenant names separated with commas (,). If you do not specify this parameter, the ongoing backup jobs of all user tenants are stopped. <main id="notice" type='notice'> <h4>Notice</h4><p>You must use the <code>TENANT = tenant_name</code> clause to specify the target tenant only when you execute this statement in the sys tenant. When you execute this statement in a user tenant, you cannot use the <code>TENANT = tenant_name</code> clause. </p></main> |

## Examples

Assume that the current cluster has three tenants respectively named `sys`, `mysql_tenant`, and `oracle_tenant`, and that both `mysql_tenant` and `oracle_tenant` have ongoing data backup jobs.

* Stop the ongoing data backup jobs of all user tenants in the cluster from the sys tenant.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL BACKUP;
   ```

   In this example, after the statement is executed, the system will stop the ongoing data backup jobs of the `mysql_tenant` and `oracle_tenant` tenants.

* Stop the ongoing data backup jobs of the `mysql_tenant` tenant in the cluster from the sys tenant.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL BACKUP TENANT = mysql_tenant;
   ```

* Stop the ongoing data backup jobs of the `oracle_tenant` tenant from the current tenant.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL BACKUP;
   ```
