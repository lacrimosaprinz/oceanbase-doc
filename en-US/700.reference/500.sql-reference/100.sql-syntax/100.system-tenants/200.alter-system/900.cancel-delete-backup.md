# CANCEL DELETE BACKUP

## Purpose

You can use the `CANCEL DELETE BACKUP` statement to cancel ongoing cleanup jobs.

If you only want to cancel ongoing jobs, you can execute the `CANCEL DELETE BACKUP` statement. If you do not want canceled cleanup jobs to be scheduled again, you must first execute the `DROP DELETE BACKUP POLICY` statement to drop the corresponding automatic cleanup strategy and then execute the `CANCEL DELETE BACKUP` statement to cancel the cleanup jobs. For more information about the `DROP DELETE BACKUP POLICY` statement, see [DELETE BACKUP](1600.delete-backup.md).

## Required privileges

You must execute this statement as the `root` user of the `sys` tenant (namely `root@sys`) or as the administrator of a user tenant.  

* The default administrator is the `root` user in MySQL mode.
* The default administrator is the `SYS` user in Oracle mode.

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL DELETE BACKUP [TENANT [=] {tenant_name[, tenant_name]...} ];
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tenant_name | The name of the tenant for which ongoing cleanup jobs are to be canceled when you execute this statement in the sys tenant. You can specify multiple tenant names separated with commas (,). If you do not specify the `TENANT = tenant_name` clause when you execute the statement in the sys tenant, the ongoing cleanup jobs of all user tenants are canceled. <main id="notice" type='notice'> <h4>Notice</h4><p>You must use the <code>TENANT = tenant_name</code> clause to specify the target tenant only when you execute this statement in the sys tenant. When you execute this statement in a user tenant, you cannot use the <code>TENANT = tenant_name</code> clause. </p></main> |

## Examples

* Drop the automatic cleanup strategy named `default` for the `mysql_tenant` tenant from the sys tenant.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM DROP DELETE BACKUP POLICY 'default' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
   ```

* Cancel the ongoing cleanup jobs of the `mysql_tenant` and `oracle_tenant` tenants from the sys tenant.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL DELETE BACKUP TENANT mysql_tenant, oracle_tenant;
   ```

* Cancel the ongoing cleanups job of the `oracle_tenant` tenant from the current tenant.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL DELETE BACKUP;
   ```
