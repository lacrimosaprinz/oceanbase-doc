# ALTER RESOURCE POOL

## Purpose

You can use the `ALTER RESOURCE POOL` statement to modify the attributes of a resource pool, including the `UNIT`, `UNIT_NUM`, and `ZONE_LIST` attributes.

## Limitations and considerations

* When you use the `ALTER RESOURCE POOL` statement to modify the attributes of a resource pool, you can modify only one attribute at a time. If you want to modify two or more attributes, execute the statement repeatedly.

* If you want to modify the `UNIT_NUM` attribute of a resource pool that has been allocated to a tenant, you must use the `ALTER RESOURCE TENANT` statement instead of the `ALTER RESOURCE POOL` statement. For more information about the `ALTER RESOURCE TENANT` statement, see [ALTER RESOURCE TENANT](300.alter-resource-tenant.md).

## Required privileges

You can modify the attributes of a tenant only as the `root` user of the `sys` tenant (namely `root@sys`).

## Syntax

### ALTER RESOURCE POOL

```sql
ALTER RESOURCE POOL pool_name
      UNIT [=] unit_name
    | UNIT_NUM [=] unit_num [DELETE UNIT = (unit_id_list)]
    | ZONE_LIST [=] ('zone_name' [, 'zone_name' ...]);
```


## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| unit_name | The unit config used by the resource pool.  |
| unit_num | The number of units in a single zone after modification. When you increase the value of `unit_num`, make sure that the value is smaller than or equal to the number of nodes in the target zone.  |
| unit_id_list | When you decrease the value of `unit_num`, you can use the `DELETE UNIT` clause to specify the IDs of the units to be deleted. If you do not use the `DELETE UNIT` clause, the system randomly deletes a corresponding number of units.  <main id><h4>Notice</h4><p>When you use <code>DELETE UNIT</code> to specify the IDs of the units to be deleted, take note of the following considerations: <ul><li> In the <code>unit_id</code> list, the number of units to be deleted from each zone must be the same. </li>   <li> The number of remaining units after the deletion in each zone must be consistent with the value of <code>unit_num</code>. </li></ul> </p></main> |
| ZONE_LIST | The list of zones for the resource pool after modification.  |

## Examples

* You can modify only one attribute of resource pool `pool1` at a time. For example, the following statement attempts to modify the `UNIT`, `UNIT_NUM`, and `ZONE_LIST` attributes at a time, and an error will occur during its execution.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER RESOURCE POOL pool1 UNIT='unit2', UNIT_NUM=1, ZONE_LIST=('zone1');
   ERROR 1235 (0A000): alter unit_num, resource_unit, zone_list in one cmd not supported
   ```

   When you decrease the value of `UNIT_NUM`, you can delete specified units.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER RESOURCE POOL pool1 UNIT_NUM=1 DELETE UNIT = (1002);
   ```

* Change the unit config of the resource pool `pool1` to `unit2`.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER RESOURCE POOL pool1 UNIT='unit2';
   ```
