# Bit value data type

The `BIT` type is used to store bit values.

A bit value is specified by using the `b'value'` notation. Here, `value` is a binary value written in zeros and ones. For example, `b'111'` indicates 7, and `b'10000000'` indicates 128.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
BIT[(M)]
```

Here, `M` specifies the total number of digits in the value. The range of `M` is \[1,64\]. If `M` is not specified, the value of `M` is 1.

When you insert a value into the `BIT(M)` column, if the length of the inserted value is less than `M`, the value is left-padded with zeros. For example, if `b'101'` is inserted into `BIT(6)`, it is equivalent to inserting `b'000101'`.
