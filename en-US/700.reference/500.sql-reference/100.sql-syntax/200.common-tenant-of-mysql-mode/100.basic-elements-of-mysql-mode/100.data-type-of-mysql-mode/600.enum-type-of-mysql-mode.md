# ENUM type

The `ENUM` type is a string object that has only one value from a value list such as `'value1', 'value2', ...`. An `ENUM` value must be a string quoted in single quotation marks (').

`ENUM` values are internally expressed as integers. An `ENUM` column supports 65,535 different elements at most, but the actual limit may be less than 3,000. The `ENUM` type supports variable data length and the `UTF8MB4` character set.

The syntax of `ENUM` is as follows:

```sql
ENUM('value1','value2',...) [CHARACTER SET charset_name] [COLLATE collation_name]
```

The `CHARACTER SET` attribute specifies the character set. If necessary, you can use `COLLATE` and other attributes to specify the collation of the character set.

The `ENUM` type has the following advantages:

* The input strings are automatically encoded into numbers. This improves the compression ratio for data storage.

* The queries and output are readable. The numbers are converted back into the corresponding strings in the query results.
