# SET type

OceanBase Database supports the `SET` type. A `SET` is a string object and can have zero or more values that must come from a list of multiple values, such as `'value1', 'value2', ...`.

The `SET` type supports variable data length and the `UTF8MB4` character set.

The syntax of `SET` is as follows:

```sql
SET('value1','value2',...) [CHARACTER SET charset_name] [COLLATE collation_name]
```

`SET` values are internally expressed as integers. You can define a maximum of 64 members in a `SET` column, and each member contains a maximum of 255 characters. Multiple members in a `SET` column are separated by commas (,).

For example, the `SET('a', 'b') NOT NULL` column can have the following values:

```sql
' '
'a'
'b'
'a,b'
```

The `CHARACTER SET` attribute specifies the character set. If necessary, you can use `COLLATE` and other attributes to specify the collation of the character set.

`SET` values are stored as numbers, and the lowest bit of the stored value corresponds to the first member of the set. `SET` values are sorted by number. `NULL` values are sorted before non-`NULL` values. In strict SQL mode, duplicate values result in alerts or errors. When you create a table, trailing spaces of members in the defined `SET` are automatically deleted.
