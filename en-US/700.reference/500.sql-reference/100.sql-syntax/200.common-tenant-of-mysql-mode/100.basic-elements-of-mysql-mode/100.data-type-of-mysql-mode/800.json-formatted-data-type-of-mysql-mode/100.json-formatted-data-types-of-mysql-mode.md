# Overview

OceanBase Database supports the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data type that complies with RFC 7159. You can store semi-structured JSON data and access and modify the data in a JSON document.

The JSON data type provides the following benefits:

* A JSON document stored in a JSON column is automatically validated. An error is returned if the document is invalid.

* A JSON document stored in a JSON column can be converted to a format that facilitates fast read and access. When a server must read a JSON value stored in the binary format, the server does not need to parse the value from the text.

In addition to the JSON data type, OceanBase Database provides a bunch of SQL functions for you to perform operations on JSON values, such as creation, manipulation, and searching.
