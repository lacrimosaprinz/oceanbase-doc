# Overview

OceanBase Database supports the following spatial data types for the geographic information system (GIS) feature:

* `GEOMETRY`

* `POINT`

* `LINESTRING`

* `POLYGON`

* `MULTIPOINT`

* `MULTILINESTRING`

* `MULTIPOLYGON`

* `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`

Among them, `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, and `POLYGON` are the three most basic data types, which are used to store a single spatial data item. `MULTIPOINT`, `MULTILINESTRING`, and `MULTIPOLYGON` are their extended collection data types respectively, which store spatial data collections of the corresponding base data types. `GEOMETRY` is a virtual data type that can represent any base data type, and `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` is a collection data type of `GEOMETRY`.
