# Create a spatial column

OceanBase Database allows you to use `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` to create spatial columns. 

The syntax of the `CREATE TABLE` statement for creating a table with spatial columns is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY);
```

The syntax of the `ALTER TABLE` statement for adding a spatial column to or dropping a spatial column from a table is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE geom ADD pt POINT;
ALTER TABLE geom DROP pt;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE geom (
    p POINT SRID 0,
    g GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326
);
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

Limitations on creating spatial columns are as follows:

* When you define a spatial column, you can explicitly specify the SRID. If no SRID is defined for a column, the optimizer does not select spatial indexes for a query, but it still generates index records for INSERT and UPDATE operations. 

* If you have specified the `NOT NULL` constraint and an SRID for a spatial column, you can define spatial indexes on the spatial column. In other words, only columns defined with SRIDs can use spatial indexes. 

* If you have defined an SRID for a spatial column, an error will be reported when you insert other SRID values. 


SRIDs are subject to the following limitations:

* The specified SRID is displayed on the spatial column. 

* The SRID must be the same for all objects in a column.
