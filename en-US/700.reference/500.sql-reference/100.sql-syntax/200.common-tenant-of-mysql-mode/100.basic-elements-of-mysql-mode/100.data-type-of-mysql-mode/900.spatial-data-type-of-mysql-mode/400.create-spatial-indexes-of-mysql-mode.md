# Create a spatial index

OceanBase Database allows you to create spatial indexes by using the syntax for creating regular indexes. However, you must use the `SPATIAL` keyword. The columns in a spatial index must be declared as `NOT NULL`. 

The following examples show how to create a spatial index:

- Use the `CREATE TABLE` statement:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326, SPATIAL INDEX(g));
    ```

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` statement:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326);
    ALTER TABLE geom ADD SPATIAL INDEX(g);
    ```

- Use the `CREATE INDEX` statement:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE geom (g GEOMETRY NOT NULL SRID 4326);
    CREATE SPATIAL INDEX g ON geom (g);
    ```

The following examples show how to drop a spatial index:

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` statement:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE geom DROP INDEX g;
    ```

- Use the `DROP INDEX` statement:

    ```sql
    DROP INDEX g ON geom;
    ```

Limitations on creating spatial indexes are as follows:

* The columns in a spatial index must be declared as `NOT NULL`. 
* After an index is created, the coordinate system of the SRID defined in the column is used for comparison. A spatial index stores the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) build of a geometry object. The comparison mode of MBR also depends on the SRID. 
* Preferably, the column on which a spatial index is created has an SRID defined. Otherwise, the spatial index created on the column cannot take effect in a query.
