# Spatial data formats

OceanBase Database supports two standard spatial data formats to represent geometry objects in a query:

* Well-known text (WKT)

* Well-known binary (WKB)

## WKT

WKT is defined in the extended Backusâ€“Naur form (EBNF). WKT can be used either as a data format (WKT-Data) or as an SRS definition in a GIS (WKT-SRS).

### Point

A Point object has coordinates that are not separated by a comma (,). Here is an example:

```sql
POINT(15 20)
```

The following examples use the `ST_X()` function to get the `X` coordinate from a Point object. The first example directly uses the `Point()` function to generate an object. The second example uses `ST_GeomFromText()` to convert a Point object into a WKT representation. 

```sql
obclient> SELECT ST_X(Point(15, 20));
+---------------------+
| ST_X(Point(15, 20)) |
+---------------------+
|                  15 |
+---------------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT ST_X(ST_GeomFromText('POINT(15 20)'));
+---------------------------------------+
| ST_X(ST_GeomFromText('POINT(15 20)')) |
+---------------------------------------+
|                                    15 |
+---------------------------------------+
1 row in set
```

### Line

A Line object consists of multiple points separated by commas (,). Here is an example:

```sql
LINESTRING(0 0, 10 10, 20 25, 50 60)
```

### Polygon

A Polygon object consists of at least one outer ring and zero or more inner rings. Here is an example:

```sql
POLYGON((0 0,10 0,10 10,0 10,0 0),(5 5,7 5,7 7,5 7, 5 5))
```

### MultiPoint

A MultiPoint object is a collection of points. It is similar to a line, but it has different semantics. Multiple points can be connected to form a line, and can form a MultiPoint object as a collection in dispersion. Here is an example:

```sql
MULTIPOINT(0 0, 20 20, 60 60)
```

In the `ST_MPointFromText()` and `ST_GeoFromText()` functions, points in a MultiPoint object can also be enclosed in parentheses. Here are some examples:

```sql
ST_MPointFromText('MULTIPOINT (1 1, 2 2, 3 3)')
ST_MPointFromText('MULTIPOINT ((1 1), (2 2), (3 3))')
```

### MultiLineString

A MultiLineString object is a collection of lines. Here is an example:

```sql
MULTILINESTRING((10 10, 20 20), (15 15, 30 15))
```

### MultiPolygon

A MultiPolygon object is a collection of polygons. Here is an example:

```sql
MULTIPOLYGON(((0 0,10 0,10 10,0 10,0 0)),((5 5,7 5,7 7,5 7, 5 5)))
```

### GeometryCollection

A GeometryCollection object is a collection of multiple objects of various base types or collections of various base types. 

```sql
GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(10 10), POINT(30 30), LINESTRING(15 15, 20 20))
```

## WKB

WKB is a format defined based on the OpenGIS specification and supports seven object types, including Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection. 

### Point

The following table takes `POINT(1 -1)` as an example to describe the format. 

| **Component** | **Size** | **Type** | **Value** |

| **Y coordinate** | 8 bytes | Double-precision | 000000000000F0BF |

### LineString

The following table takes `LINESTRING(1 -1, -1 1)` as an example to describe the format. `Num points` must be greater than or equal to 2. 

| **Component** | **Size** | **Type** | **Value** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Byte order** | 1 byte | Unsigned int | 01 |

## Syntactic and geometric validity

### Syntactic validity

The spatial data must meet the following syntactic validity requirements:

- A LineString object has at least 2 points.
- A Polygon object has at least one ring.
- A Polygon object starts and ends at the same point to form a closed ring.
- A Polygon object has at least 4 points for its outer ring. A Polygon object with 3 points is a triangle, with the first and the last points being the same.
- Only GeometryCollection objects can be empty, which means that 0 elements are stored. All other types cannot be empty.

### Geometric validity

The spatial data must meet the following geometric validity requirements:

- A Polygon object cannot intersect with itself.
- The outer ring of a Polygon object is outside its inner ring.
- The polygons in a MultiPolygon object do not overlap with each other.

You can use the `ST_IsValid()` function explicitly check the geometric validity of geometries. 

## GIS examples

### Insert

```sql
// Place both the conversion function and WKT in the SQL statement.
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (ST_GeomFromText('POINT(1 1)'));

// Place WKT in the arguments.
SET @g = 'POINT(1 1)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (ST_GeomFromText(@g));

// Place the conversion expression directly in the arguments.
SET @g = ST_GeomFromText('POINT(1 1)');
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (@g);

// Use a unified conversion function.
SET @g = 'LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (ST_GeomFromText(@g));

SET @g = 'POLYGON((0 0,10 0,10 10,0 10,0 0),(5 5,7 5,7 7,5 7, 5 5))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (ST_GeomFromText(@g));

SET @g ='GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2,3 3,4 4))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (ST_GeomFromText(@g));

// Use a type-based conversion function.
SET @g = 'POINT(1 1)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (ST_PointFromText(@g));

SET @g = 'LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2)';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (ST_LineStringFromText(@g));

SET @g = 'POLYGON((0 0,10 0,10 10,0 10,0 0),(5 5,7 5,7 7,5 7, 5 5))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (ST_PolygonFromText(@g));

SET @g =
'GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1,2 2,3 3,4 4))';
INSERT INTO geom VALUES (ST_GeomCollFromText(@g));

// It can also be inserted directly based on WKB.
INSERT INTO geom VALUES(ST_GeomFromWKB(X'0101000000000000000000F03F000000000000F03F'));
```

### Query

```sql
// Perform a query and convert the result into a WKT output.
SELECT ST_AsText(g) FROM geom;

// Perform a query and convert the result into a WKB output.
SELECT ST_AsBinary(g) FROM geom;
```
