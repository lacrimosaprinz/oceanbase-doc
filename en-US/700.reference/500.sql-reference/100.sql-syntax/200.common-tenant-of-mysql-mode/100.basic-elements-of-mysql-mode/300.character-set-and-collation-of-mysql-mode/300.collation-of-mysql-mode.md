    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>For any Unicode character set, the operation is executed faster if the character set is sorted by a general collation <code>xxx_general_ci</code> instead of a Unicode collation <code>xxx_unicode_ci</code>. </li>
    <li>You cannot modify the collations. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>

By default, you can execute the `SHOW COLLATION` statement to display all available collations.

```sql
obclient> SHOW COLLATION;

General characteristics of collations are as follows:

* Two different character sets cannot use the same collation.

* Each character set uses a default collation. You can execute the `SHOW CHARACTER SET` statement to indicate the default collation of each character set. The execution result of the `SHOW COLLATION` statement has a column that indicates whether a collation is the default collation of its character set. If yes, the value is `Yes`. Otherwise, the value is empty.

* The name of a collation starts with the name of the corresponding character set. In most cases, the name is followed by one or more suffix items that indicate other characteristics of the collation.
