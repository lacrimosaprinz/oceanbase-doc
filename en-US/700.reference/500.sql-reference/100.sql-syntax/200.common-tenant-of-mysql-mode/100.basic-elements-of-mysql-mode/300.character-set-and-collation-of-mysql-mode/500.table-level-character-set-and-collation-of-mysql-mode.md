# Table-level character sets and collations

Every table in OceanBase Database is created with a default character set and collation.

## Specify the character set and collation of a table

You can execute the `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` statement to specify the character set and collation of a table by using the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (column_list)
    [[DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET [=] charset_name]
    [COLLATE [=] collation_name]

ALTER TABLE table_name
    [DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET [=] charset_name
    [COLLATE [=] collation_name]
```

You can modify the character set and collation of existing data in a table by using the following syntax:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tbl_name CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET charset_name COLLATE col_name;
```

Here are some examples:

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE test_collation (c1 INT, c2 VARCHAR(32), c3 VARCHAR(32), PRIMARY KEY (c1),UNIQUE KEY idx_test_collation_c2(c2));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

// Modify the character set and collation of a table.
obclient> ALTER TABLE test_collation CHARACTER SET = utf8mb4 COLLATE = utf8mb4_bin;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

// Modify the character set and collation of existing data in a table, and modify the corresponding settings.
obclient> ALTER TABLE test_collation CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Select the character set and collation of a table

You can select the character set and collation of a table by using the following methods in OceanBase Database:

* If you specify both the `CHARACTER SET charset_name` and `COLLATE collation_name` parameters, the `charset_name` character set and `collation_name` collation are used.

* If you specify only the `CHARACTER SET charset_name` parameter, the specified `charset_name` character set and the associated default collation are used. To view the default collation for each character set, execute the `SHOW CHARACTER SET` statement.

* If you specify only the `COLLATE collation_name` parameter, the specified `collation_name` collation and the associated character set are used.

* If neither `CHARACTER SET` nor `COLLATE` is specified, the character set and collation for the server are used.

If the column-level character set and collation are not specified in the definition of each column, the table-level character set and collation are used by default.
