# Datetime values

OceanBase Database supports datetime literals in string and number formats.

Differences between strings and numbers:

* A string can contain all delimiters, such as `'2015-07-21 12:34:56.789'`, or no delimiters, such as `'20150721'`.

* A number can use only a decimal point (`.`) as the delimiter between seconds and microseconds, such as `20150721123456.789`.

When you need to use delimiters in other scenarios, we recommend that you use only dashes (`-`), forward slashes (`/`), and colons (`:`).

## DATE values

OceanBase Database recognizes a `DATE` value in one of the following formats:

* `'YYYY-MM-DD'` or `'YY-MM-DD'`. Any punctuation characters can be used as delimiters between date parts. For example, '2012-12-31', '2012/12/31', '2012\^12\^31', and '2012@12@31' are equivalent.

* `'YYYYMMDD'` or `'YYMMDD'`, provided that the string is a meaningful date value. For example, '20070523' or '070523' can be parsed as '2007-05-23', but '071532' is invalid and returns `NULL` because it contains meaningless month and day parts.

* `'YYYYMMDD'` or `'YYMMDD'`, provided that the number is a meaningful date value. For example, 19830905 or 830905 can be parsed as "1983-09-05".

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>If sql_mode contains <code>STRICT_TRANS_TABLES</code> or <code>NO_ZERO_IN_DATE</code>, and the month or day part of a date contains 0, an error is returned, except for '0000-00-00'. </p>
  </main>

## DATETIME and TIMESTAMP values

OceanBase Database recognizes a `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP` value in the following formats:

* `'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'` or `'YY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'`. Any punctuation characters can be used as delimiters between date or time parts. For example, '2012-12-31 11:30:45', '2012\^12\^31 11+30+45', '2012/12/31 11\*30\*45', and '2012@12@31 11\^30\^45' are equivalent.

   Note that the decimal point is the only delimiter that is recognizable between a date and time part and a fractional part of seconds. The date and time parts can be separated either by a letter `T` or a space. For example, '2012-12-31 11:30:45' and '2012-12-31T11:30:45' are equivalent.

* `'YYYYMMDDhhmmss'` or `'YYMMDDhhmmss'`, provided that the string is a meaningful date value. For example, '20070523091528' or '070523091528' can be parsed as '2007-05-23 09:15:28', but '071122129015' is invalid and returns `NULL` because it contains a meaningless minute part.

* `YYYYMMDDhhmmss` or `YYMMDDhhmmss`, provided that the string is a meaningful date value. For example, 19830905132800 and 830905132800 can be parsed as '1983-09-05 13:28:00'.

A `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP` value can include a trailing fractional seconds part of at most 6 digits to achieve a precision of up to microseconds. The fractional part can be separated from other time parts only with a decimal point. Other fractional part delimiters are unrecognizable.

OceanBase Database uses the following rules to parse a date that contains a two-digit year value:

* A year value in the range of 70-99 becomes 1970-1999.

* A year value in the range of 00-69 becomes 2000-2069.

You do not need to specify two digits for a month or day value that is less than 10. For example, '2015-6-9' is equivalent to '2015-06-09'. Likewise, you do not need to specify two digits for an hour, minute, or second value that is smaller than 10. For example, '2015-10-30 1:2:3' is equivalent to '2015-10-30 01:02:03'.

In addition, OceanBase Database selects a format based on the value length:

* `YYMMDD` for a 6-digit value

* `YYYYMMDD` for an 8-digit value

* `YYMMDDHHMMSS` for a 12-digit value

* `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` for a 14-digit value

## TIME values

OceanBase Database recognizes a `TIME` value in one of the following formats:

* `'D hh:mm:ss'`, or any of the following: `'hh:mm:ss'`, `'hh:mm'`, `'D hh:mm'`, `'D hh'`, and `'ss'`. `D` represents the number of days, and the valid values are an integer from 0 to 34.

* `'hhmmss'` without delimiters, provided that the number is a meaningful date value. For example, '101112' can be parsed as '10:11:12', but '109712' is invalid and becomes '00:00:00' because it contains a meaningless minute part.

* `hhmmss`, or any of the following: `ss`, `mmss`, and `hhmmss`, provided that the number is a meaningful date value. For example, 101112 can be parsed as '10:11:12'.

A trailing fractional seconds part is recognized in the following formats: `'D hh:mm:ss.fraction'`, `'hh:mm:ss.fraction'`, `'hhmmss.fraction'`, and `hhmmss.fraction`. The fractional part can contain at most 6 digits to achieve a precision of up to microseconds. The fractional part can be separated from other time parts only with a decimal point. Other fractional part delimiters are unrecognizable.
