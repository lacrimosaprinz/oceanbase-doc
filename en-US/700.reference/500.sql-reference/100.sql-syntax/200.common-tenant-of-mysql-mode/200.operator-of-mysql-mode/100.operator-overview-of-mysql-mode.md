# Overview

An operator manipulates individual operands or arguments and returns a result. Syntactically, an operator can appear before an operand, after an operand, or between two operands.

General operators can be categorized into unary and binary operators.

* Unary operators

   A unary operator operates on only one operand. Unary operators and operands are written in the following format:

   ```sql
   operator operand
   ```

* Binary operators

   A binary operator manipulates two operands. Binary operators and operands are written in the following format:

   ```sql
   operand1 operator operand2
   ```

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Other operators with special formats can accept more than two operands. </li>
    <li>If an operator is given a NULL operand, the result is always <code>NULL</code>. The only exception is the concatenation operator (||). </li>
    </ul>
  </main>
