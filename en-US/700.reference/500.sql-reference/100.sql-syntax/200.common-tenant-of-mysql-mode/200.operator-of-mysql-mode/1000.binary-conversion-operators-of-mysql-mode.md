# BINARY operator

OceanBase Database supports the BINARY operator for forcible conversion.

## Syntax

The syntax of the BINARY operator is as follows:

```sql
BINARY expr
```

The BINARY operator converts a string specified by `expr` into a binary string, that is, a string with the binary character set and collation.
In string comparison, BINARY is usually used to compare the binary values of strings, rather than to compare strings character by character. Trailing zeros need to be considered during comparison. Here are some examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT 'aa' = 'AA';
+-------------+
| 'aa' = 'AA' |
+-------------+
|           1 |
+-------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT BINARY 'aa' = 'AA';
+--------------------+
| BINARY 'aa' = 'AA' |
+--------------------+
|                  0 |
+--------------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT 'aa' = 'aa ';
+--------------+
| 'aa' = 'aa ' |
+--------------+
|            1 |
+--------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT BINARY 'aa' = 'aa ';
+---------------------+
| BINARY 'aa' = 'aa ' |
+---------------------+
|                   0 |
+---------------------+
1 row in set
```

## Binary string conversion

In OceanBase Database, you can convert a string expression into a binary string in the following three ways:

```sql
CONVERT(expr USING BINARY)
CAST(expr AS BINARY)
BINARY expr
```

Pay attention that the `BINARY` operator in the expression and the `BINARY` data type defined in the character column have different effects. For a column defined by using the `BINARY` attribute, the database assigns the default character set and the binary (_bin) collation of this character set to the table. Each non-binary character set has a binary collation. For example, if the default character set of a table is GBK, the following two column definitions are equivalent:

```sql
CHAR(5) BINARY
<=>
CHAR(5) CHARACTER SET gbk COLLATE gbk_bin
```

If you use `CHARACTER SET binary` in the definition of a `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, or `TEXT` column, this column is treated as the corresponding binary string data type. The definitions in the following example are equivalent:

```sql
CHAR(5) CHARACTER SET binary
<=>
BINARY(5)

VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET binary
<=>
VARBINARY(10)

TEXT CHARACTER SET binary
<=>
BLOB
```
