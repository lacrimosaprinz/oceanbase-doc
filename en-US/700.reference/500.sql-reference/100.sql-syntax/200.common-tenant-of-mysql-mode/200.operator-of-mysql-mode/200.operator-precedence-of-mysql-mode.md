# Operator precedence

OceanBase Database supports multiple operators, such as arithmetic operators, bitwise operators, comparison operators, logical operators, date and time operators, concatenation operators, and collation operators.

## Overview

The following list shows operators sorted by precedence from high to low. Operators listed in the same row have the same precedence.

```sql
COLLATE
!
- (unary minus operator), ~ (unary bitwise NOT operator)
^
*, /, DIV, %, MOD
-, +
<<, >>
&
|
= (comparison), <=>, >=, >, <=, <, <>, !=, IN
BETWEEN,
NOT
AND, &&
XOR
OR, ||
= (assignment), :=
```

## Description

* The precedence of an equal sign (`=`) depends on whether it is used as a comparison operator or an assignment operator. A comparison operator has the same precedence as `<=>`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `<>`, and `!=`. An assignment operator has the same precedence as `:=`.

* If operators with equal precedence exist in the same expression, the evaluation is performed from left to right. However, assignment is performed from right to left.

* The precedence and meaning of the following operators depend on the SQL mode:

   * By default, `||` is a logical `OR` operator. If `PIPES_AS_CONCAT` is enabled, `||` is the string concatenation, with the precedence between `^` and unary operators.

   * By default, `!`  has higher precedence than `NOT`. If `HIGH_NOT_PRECEDENCE` is enabled, `!`  and NOT have equal precedence.
