# Arithmetic operators

OceanBase Database supports general arithmetic operators.

## Overview

The following table lists the arithmetic operators that are supported by the current version of OceanBase Database.

| Operator | Operand type | Description |
|-------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `+` | Unary/Binary | The unary plus (+) indicates a positive number, and the binary plus is the addition operator.  |
| `-` | Unary/Binary | The unary minus (-) indicates a negative number, and the binary minus is the subtraction operator.  |
| `*` | Binary | The multiplication operator.  |
| `/` | Binary | The general division operator.  |
| `DIV` | Binary | Returns the quotient of an integer division.  |
| `MOD` or `%` | Binary | Returns the remainder of an integer division. `N % M` or `N MOD M` returns the remainder of dividing N by M.  |

## Description

### Operation rules

Operation rules of integer division are as follows:

* The quotient is rounded off toward 0 regardless of whether the quotient is positive or negative.

* The positive/negative attribute of the remainder is the same as that of the dividend.

Here are some examples:

```javascript
obclient> SELECT (-7) DIV (3.6), (-7) MOD (3.6);
+----------------+----------------+
| (-7) DIV (3.6) | (-7) MOD (3.6) |
+----------------+----------------+
|             -1 |           -3.4 |
+----------------+----------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT (-7) DIV (-3.4), (-7) % (-3.4);
+-----------------+---------------+
| (-7) DIV (-3.4) | (-7) % (-3.4) |
+-----------------+---------------+
|               2 |          -0.2 |
+-----------------+---------------+
1 row in set
```

### Operation results

The results of arithmetic operations are determined by the following rules:

* If both operands of the `-`, `+`, and `*` operators are integers, the result is calculated with `BIGINT` (64-bit) precision.

* If both operands of an operation are integers and one of them is unsigned, the result is an unsigned integer. In a subtraction operation, if the `NO_UNSIGNED_SUBTRACTION` SQL mode is enabled, the result is signed even if any operand is unsigned.

* If the operands of the `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, and `%` operators are real numbers or strings, the precision of the result is the precision of the operand with the maximum precision.

* When you perform a division operation with two exact-value operands by using the `/` operator, the number of decimal places of the result are the number of decimal places of the first operand plus the value of the `div_precision_increment` variable. By default, the value of this variable is 4. For example, the result of the expression 5.15/0.013 is 396.153846, which has six decimal places.
