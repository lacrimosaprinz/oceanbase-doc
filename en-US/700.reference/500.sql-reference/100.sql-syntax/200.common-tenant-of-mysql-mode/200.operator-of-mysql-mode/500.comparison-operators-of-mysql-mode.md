# Comparison operators

OceanBase Database supports general comparison operators.

## Overview

The following table describes the comparison operators supported by OceanBase Database.

| Operator | Operand | Description | Result of a NULL input |
|---------------------|-----|--------------|------------------|
| `=` | Binary | The equal operator. | `NULL` |
| `<=>` | Binary | The NULL-safe equal to operator. | For more information, see the following description. |
| `<>` / `!=` | Binary | The not equal operator. | `NULL` |
| `>` | Binary | The greater than operator. | `NULL` |
| `>=` | Binary | The greater than or equal to operator. | `NULL` |
| `<` | Binary | The less than operator. | `NULL` |
| `<=` | Binary | The less than or equal to operator. | `NULL` |
| `[NOT] IN` | Binary | Whether a value is not within a specified set of values. | For more information, see the following description. |
| `[NOT] BETWEEN AND` | Ternary | Whether a value is not within a specified range of values. | For more information, see the following description. |
| `[NOT] LIKE` | Ternary | The operator that matches wildcards in a string. | For more information, see the following description. |
| `IS [NOT] TRUE` | Unary | Whether a value is `TRUE`. | `TRUE` or `FALSE` |
| `IS [NOT] FALSE` | Unary | Whether a value is `FALSE`. | `TRUE` or `FALSE` |
| `IS [NOT] NULL` | Unary | Whether a value is `NULL`. | `TRUE` or `FALSE` |

## Description

The result of a comparison is 1 (`TRUE`), 0 (`FALSE`), or `NULL`. An operand can be a number or a string. Strings and numbers are automatically converted to each other as needed. By default, string comparisons are case-insensitive and use the current character set.

The following sections describe the syntax of some operators and the operation results if a `NULL` input is used.

### \<=\>

In an operation that contains the `<=>` operator, if both operands are `NULL`, 1 is returned. If only one operand is `NULL`, 0 is returned. Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT 1 <=> 1, NULL <=> NULL, 1 <=> NULL;
+---------+---------------+------------+
| 1 <=> 1 | NULL <=> NULL | 1 <=> NULL |
+---------+---------------+------------+
|       1 |             1 |          0 |
+---------+---------------+------------+
1 row in set
```

### \[NOT\] IN

The syntax of the `IN` operation is as follows:

```sql
expr IN (value,...)
```

The `NOT IN` syntax is equivalent to `NOT (expr IN (value,...))` or `expr NOT IN (value,...)`.

In an operation that contains the `IN` operator, if `expr` equals any value in the `value,...` list, 1 (`TRUE`) is returned. Otherwise, 0 (`FALSE`) is returned. When `expr` is `NULL`, `NULL` is returned. When `expr` is not `NULL` and the set contains `NULL`, if any non-`NULL` value in the set equals `expr`, `TRUE` is returned. Otherwise, `NULL` is returned.

We recommend that you do not mix quoted and unquoted values in the `value,...` list. This returns inconsistent results because the comparison rules for quoted values (such as strings) and unquoted values (such as numbers) are different.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT 1 IN (1, NULL), 1 IN (2, NULL);
+----------------+----------------+
| 1 IN (1, NULL) | 1 IN (2, NULL) |
+----------------+----------------+
|              1 |           NULL |
+----------------+----------------+
1 row in set
```

### \[NOT\] BETWEEN AND

The syntax of the `BETWEEN AND` operation is as follows:

```sql
expr BETWEEN min AND max
```

`NOT BETWEEN AND` is equivalent to `NOT (expr BETWEEN min AND max)` or `expr NOT BETWEEN min AND max`.

In a `BETWEEN AND` operation, if `expr` is greater than or equals `min` and is less than or equals `max`, 1 is returned. Otherwise, 0 is returned. If all arguments are of the same data type, the `BETWEEN AND` operation is equivalent to the following expression: `(min <= expr AND expr <= max)`.

When `expr` is `NULL`, or `min` and `max` are both `NULL`, the result is `NULL`. When `expr` is not `NULL`, and only `min` or `max` is `NULL`, if the operation result can be determined only by using `expr` and `min` or `max`, this operation result is used. Otherwise, `NULL` is returned.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT 1 BETWEEN 0 AND NULL, 1 BETWEEN 2 AND NULL;
+----------------------+----------------------+
| 1 BETWEEN 0 AND NULL | 1 BETWEEN 2 AND NULL |
+----------------------+----------------------+
|                 NULL |                    0 |
+----------------------+----------------------+
1 row in set
```

### \[NOT\] LIKE

The syntax of the `LIKE` operation is as follows:

```sql
expr LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape_char']
```

The `NOT LIKE` syntax is equivalent to `NOT (expr LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape_char'])` or `expr NOT LIKE pat [ESCAPE 'escape_char']`.

You can use `LIKE` to match a string that contains a wildcard. The return value is 1 (`TRUE`) or 0 (`FALSE`). If `expr` or `pat` is `NULL`, the result is `NULL`. You can use the `ESCAPE` parameter to define escape characters. If `pat` contains `escape_char`, the characters after `escape_char` are processed as ordinary characters during the match.

Two types of wildcards are supported:

* `%`: matches a string of any length.

* `_`: matches a single character.

Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> SELECT 'ab%' LIKE 'abc%' ESCAPE 'c';
+------------------------------+
| 'ab%' LIKE 'abc%' ESCAPE 'c' |
+------------------------------+
|                            1 |
+------------------------------+
1 row in set
```
