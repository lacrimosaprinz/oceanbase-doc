# Logical operators

OceanBase Database supports general logical operators.

## Overview

The following table describes the logical operators supported by OceanBase Database.

| Operator | Operand | Description |
|------------|-----|------|
| `NOT`/`!` | Unary | The logical NOT operator. |
| `AND`/`&&` | Binary | The logical AND operator. |
| `OR`/`\|\|` | Binary | The logical OR operator. |
| `XOR` | Multinary | The logical XOR operator. |

## Description

All SQL logical operators evaluate to `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NULL (UNKNOWN)`. OceanBase Database implements `TRUE` as 1, `FALSE` as 0, and `NULL` as null, and evaluates any non-zero, non-NULL value to `TRUE`.

### NOT/!

If the operand is 0, the result is 1. If the operand is not 0, the result is 0. If the operand is `NOT NULL`, the result is `NULL`.

Here are some examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT NOT NULL;
+----------+
| NOT NULL |
+----------+
|     NULL |
+----------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT ! (1+1);
+---------+
| ! (1+1) |
+---------+
|       0 |
+---------+
1 row in set
```

### AND/\&\&

If all operands are not 0 and not `NULL`, the result is 1. If one or more operands are 0, the result is 0. Otherwise, `NULL` is returned.

Here are some examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT 1 AND NULL;
+------------+
| 1 AND NULL |
+------------+
|       NULL |
+------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT 0 AND NULL;
+------------+
| 0 AND NULL |
+------------+
|          0 |
+------------+
1 row in set
```

### OR/\|\|

If both operands are not `NULL`, and any operand is not 0, the result is 1. Otherwise, 0 is returned. If one operand is `NULL` and the other operand is not 0, the result is 1. Otherwise, `NULL` is returned. If both operands are `NULL`, the result is `NULL`.

Here are some examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT 0 OR NULL;
+-----------+
| 0 OR NULL |
+-----------+
|      NULL |
+-----------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT 1 OR NULL;
+-----------+
| 1 OR NULL |
+-----------+
|         1 |
+-----------+
1 row in set
```

### XOR

If any operand is `NULL`, the result is `NULL`. If operands are not `NULL`, and an odd number of operands is not 0, the result is 1. Otherwise, 0 is returned.

Here are some examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT 1 XOR NULL;
+------------+
| 1 XOR NULL |
+------------+
|       NULL |
+------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT 1 XOR 1 XOR 1;
+---------------+
| 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 |
+---------------+
|             1 |
+---------------+
1 row in set
```
