# Assignment operators

OceanBase Database supports general assignment operators.

## Overview

| Operator | Operand | Description |
|-----|-----|----------------------------------------------------|
| := | Unary | Assigns the value on the right of the operator to the variable on the left. |
| = | Unary | Assigns a value as a part of the `SET` statement or as a part of the `SET` clause in the `UPDATE` statement. |

## Description

### Assignment operator (:=)

The value on the right side of `:=` can be a literal, variable, or valid expression, including the result of a query, provided that the result is a scalar value. You can perform multiple assignments in a `SET` statement. You can perform multiple assignments in the same statement.

Unlike `=`, the `:=` operator is not parsed as a comparison operator. This means that you can use the `:=` operator to assign a value to a variable in any valid SQL statement, not just in a `SET` statement.

Here are some examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT @var1 := 1, @var2;
+------------+-------+
| @var1 := 1 | @var2 |
+------------+-------+
|          1 | NULL  |
+------------+-------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT @var1:=COUNT(*) FROM t1;
+-----------------+
| @var1:=COUNT(*) |
+-----------------+
|               5 |
+-----------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT @var1;
+-------+
| @var1 |
+-------+
|     5 |
+-------+
1 row in set
```

### Assignment operator (=)

You can use the `=` operator for value assignments in the following two cases:

* Assign the value on the right side of the `=` operator to the variable on its left in a `SET` statement. In other words, `=` and `:=` are equivalent in a `SET` statement.

* You can also use `=` as an assignment operator in the `SET` clause of an `UPDATE` statement. In this case, if the `WHERE` conditions in the `UPDATE` statement are met, the value on the right side of the operator is assigned to the column on its left. You can perform multiple assignments in the same `SET` clause of an `UPDATE` statement.

The `=` operator is used as a comparison operator in all other cases.

```sql
obclient>  SELECT * FROM t1;
+------+------+
| c1   | c2   |
+------+------+
|    1 |    1 |
+------+------+
1 row in set

obclient> UPDATE t1 SET c1 = c1 + 1, c2 = c1;
Query OK, 1 row affected
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
+------+------+
| c1   | c2   |
+------+------+
|    2 |    2 |
+------+------+
1 row in set
```
