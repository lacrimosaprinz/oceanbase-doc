OceanBase Database supports concatenation operators.

The following table describes the concatenation operators supported by OceanBase Database.

| Operator | Operand | Description |

You can specify the role of the logical OR operator (`||`) by setting the `sql_mode` parameter.

* If `sql_mode` includes `PIPES_AS_CONCAT`, `||` is used as a concatenation operator.

* If `sql_mode` does not include `PIPES_AS_CONCAT`, `||` is used as a logical OR operator.
