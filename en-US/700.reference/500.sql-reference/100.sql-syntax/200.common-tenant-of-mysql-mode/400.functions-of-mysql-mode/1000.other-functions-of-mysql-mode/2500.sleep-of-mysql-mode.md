# SLEEP

## Syntax

```sql
SLEEP(duration)
```

## Purpose

`SLEEP()` pauses a period that you specified for `duration` in seconds. It returns `0` when the pause period ends.

* If `SLEEP()` is separately executed and not interrupted, `0` is returned.

* If `SLEEP()` is interrupted during separate execution, `1` is returned without any error code.

* If `SLEEP()` is a part of a query and is interrupted during the pause, it returns `ERROR 1317`.

## Examples

```sql
obclient> SELECT SLEEP(1000);
+------------------+
| SLEEP(1000)      |
+------------------+
|          0       |
+------------------+

obclient> SELECT SLEEP(1000);
+------------------+
| SLEEP(1000)      |
+------------------+
|          1       |
+------------------+

obclient> SELECT 1 FROM t1 WHERE SLEEP(1000);
ERROR 1317 (70100): Query execution was interrupted
```
