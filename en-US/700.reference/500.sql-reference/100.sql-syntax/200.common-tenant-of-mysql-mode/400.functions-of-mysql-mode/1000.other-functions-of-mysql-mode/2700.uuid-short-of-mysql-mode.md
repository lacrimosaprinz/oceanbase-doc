# UUID_SHORT

## Syntax

```sql
UUID_SHORT()
```

## Purpose

`UUID_SHORT()` returns a short universal identifier as a 64-bit unsigned integer.

If the following conditions are met, the value returned by `UUID_SHORT()` is unique:

* The `server_id` of the current server ranges from 0 and 255 and is unique within a group of source and replica servers. If the sum of `server_id` values is greater than 256, the generated short universal identifier may not be unique in space, although this function does not return an error.

* Do not set the system time of an OBServer node during its restart.

* During the restart of an OBServer node, the `UUID_SHORT()` function is called less than 16 million times per second on average.

The structure of the value returned by `UUID_SHORT()` is as follows:

```sql
(server_id & 255) << 56
+ (server_startup_time_in_seconds << 24)
+ incremented_variable++;
```

## Examples

```sql
obclient> SELECT UUID_SHORT();
+-----------------------+
|          UUID_SHORT() |
+-----------------------+
| 92395783831158784     |
+-----------------------+
1 row in set
```
