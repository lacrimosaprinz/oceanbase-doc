# NAME_CONST

## Syntax

```sql
NAME_CONST(name,value)
```

## Purpose

`NAME_CONST()` returns the specified value. `value` must be a constant.

The column generated by `NAME_CONST()` has the given name.

## Examples

```sql
obclient> SELECT NAME_CONST('my_id', 101);
+-------+
| my_id |
+-------+
|   101 |
+-------+
1 row in set
```

You can obtain the same results as the preceding example by using simple aliasing:

```sql
SELECT 101 AS my_id;
```
