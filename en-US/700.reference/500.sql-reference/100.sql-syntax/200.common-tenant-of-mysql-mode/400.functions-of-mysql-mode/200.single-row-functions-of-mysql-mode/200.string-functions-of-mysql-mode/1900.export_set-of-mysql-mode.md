# EXPORT_SET

## Syntax

```sql
EXPORT_SET(bits,on,off[,separator[,number_of_bits]])
```

## Purpose

`EXPORT_SET()` returns a string, that is, an `on` string for the bits that are specified in `bits`, and an `off` string for the bits that are not specified in `bits`. The bits in `bits` are checked from right to left, that is, from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).

The string is added to the result from left to right, separated with the character defined by `separator`, which is a comma (,) by default. The number of checked bits is specified by `number_of_bits`. If this parameter is not specified, the default value 64 takes effect. If you set `number_of_bits` to a value greater than 64, the value is trimmed to 64 by default. The value of `number_of_bits` is an unsigned integer. Therefore, the value -1 is equivalent to the value 64.

## Examples

```sql
obclient> SELECT EXPORT_SET(6, '1','0',',', 10);
+--------------------------------+
| EXPORT_SET(6, '1','0',',', 10) |
+--------------------------------+
| 0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0            |
+--------------------------------+
1 row in set
```
