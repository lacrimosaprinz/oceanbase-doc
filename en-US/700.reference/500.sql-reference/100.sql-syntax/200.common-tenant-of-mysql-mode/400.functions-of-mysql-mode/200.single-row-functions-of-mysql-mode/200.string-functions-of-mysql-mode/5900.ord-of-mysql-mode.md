# ORD

## Syntax

```sql
ORD(str)
```

## Purpose

`ORD()` returns the code of the leftmost character in a string. If the leftmost character of a string is a multi-byte character, `ORD(str)` returns the code of the multi-byte character based on the following formula:

```sql
(1st byte code)
+ (2nd byte code * 256)
+ (3rd byte code * 256^2)...
```

If the leftmost character is not a multi-byte character, `ORD()` returns the same value as `ASCII()`.

## Examples

```sql
obclient> SELECT ORD ('Hello');
+---------------+
| ORD ('Hello') |
+---------------+
|            72 |
+---------------+
1 row in set
```
