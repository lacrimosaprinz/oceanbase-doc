# RPAD

## Syntax

```sql
RPAD(str,len,padstr)
```

## Purpose

`RPAD()` right-pads the `str` string with the `padstr` string to a length of `len` characters.

* If the length of `str` exceeds `len`, the leftmost `len` characters of `str` are returned.

* If the length of `str` is less than `len` but the length of `str` right-padded with `padstr` is greater than `len`, then the leftmost `len` characters of the string generated after padding are returned.

* If the length of `str` is less than `len` and the length of `str` right-padded with `padstr` is still less than `len`, then `str` is right-padded with multiple `padstr` strings until the length is greater than or equal to `len`, and the leftmost `len` characters of the string generated after padding are returned.

## Examples

```sql
obclient> SELECT RPAD('hi',5,'?');
+------------------+
| RPAD('hi',5,'?') |
+------------------+
| hi???            |
+------------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT RPAD('hi',1,'?');
+------------------+
| RPAD('hi',1,'?') |
+------------------+
| h                |
+------------------+
1 row in set
```
