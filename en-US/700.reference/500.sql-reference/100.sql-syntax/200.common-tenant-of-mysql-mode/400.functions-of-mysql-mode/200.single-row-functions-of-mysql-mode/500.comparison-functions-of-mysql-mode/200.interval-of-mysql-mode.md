# INTERVAL

## Syntax

```sql
INTERVAL(N,N1,N2,N3,...)
```

## Purpose

`INTERVAL()` returns the result of comparing `N` with a list of other arguments, such as `N1,N2,...`. In this topic, N is compared with N~1~, N~2~, ..., N~n~, which respectively represent `N1, N2, ..., and Nn` in the syntax.

`N` is compared with N~n~ in sequence:

* If `N` is `NULL`, `NULL` is returned.

* If `N` is less than N~1~, 0 is returned.

* If a positive integer n satisfies that any positive integer m less than or equal to n results in `N` being greater than or equal to N~m~ but less than N~n+1~, n is returned. If N~m~ is `NULL`, `N` is greater than or equal to N~m~.

## Examples

```sql
obclient> SELECT INTERVAL(23, 1, 15, 17, 30, 44, 200);
+--------------------------------------+
| INTERVAL(23, 1, 15, 17, 30, 44, 200) |
+--------------------------------------+
|                                    3 |
+--------------------------------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT INTERVAL(23, 1, 15, 17, NULL, 44, 200);
+----------------------------------------+
| INTERVAL(23, 1, 15, 17, NULL, 44, 200) |
+----------------------------------------+
|                                      4 |
+----------------------------------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT INTERVAL(23, 1, 15, 17, 30, 17, 200);
+--------------------------------------+
| INTERVAL(23, 1, 15, 17, 30, 17, 200) |
+--------------------------------------+
|                                    3 |

1 row in set
