# BIT_XOR

## Syntax

```sql
BIT_XOR(expr)
```

## Purpose

`BIT_XOR()` returns the bitwise XOR of all bits in `expr`.

The result is a binary string or a number. This depends on the type of the argument value. When the argument value contains a binary string and the argument is not a hexadecimal, bit, or `NULL` literal, a binary string result is calculated. Otherwise, a numeric result is calculated. If necessary, the function converts the argument value to an unsigned 64-bit integer.

If no matching row is found, `BIT_XOR()` returns a neutral value whose all bits are set to 0. The neutral value has the same length as the argument value.

`NULL` has no effect on the result unless all values are `NULL`. In this case, the result is a neutral value that has the same length as the argument value.

## Examples

```sql
obclient> SELECT year,month,BIT_COUNT(BIT_XOR(1<<day)) AS days FROM tbl1 GROUP BY year,month;
+------+-------+------+
| year | month | days |
+------+-------+------+
| 2021 |    01 |    3 |
| 2021 |    02 |    1 |
+------+-------+------+
2 rows in set
```
