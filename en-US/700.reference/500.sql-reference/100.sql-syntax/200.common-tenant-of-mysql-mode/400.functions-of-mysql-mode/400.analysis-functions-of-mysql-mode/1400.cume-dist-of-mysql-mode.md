# CUME_DIST

## Syntax

```sql
CUME_DIST() OVER ([ query_partition_clause ] order_by_clause)
```

## Purpose

`CUME_DIST()` calculates the cumulative distribution of a value. The return value is greater than `0` but less than or equal to `1`. As an analytic function, `CUME_DIST()` calculates the proportion of data that is smaller than the value of a specific column of the current row in ascending order.

## Examples

Given that the data is grouped by `job_id` and sorted by salary in ascending order, the function returns the proportion of each row of data on the sorting column of the window.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE employees(last_name CHAR(10), salary DECIMAL, job_id CHAR(32));
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('JIM', 2000, 'CLEANER');
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('MIKE', 12000, 'ENGINEERING');
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('LILY', 13000, 'ENGINEERING');
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('IRIS', 11000, 'ENGINEERING');
INSERT INTO employees VALUES('TOM', 11000, 'ENGINEERING');
COMMIT;
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT last_name, CUME_DIST() OVER(PARTITION BY job_id ORDER BY salary) cume_dist FROM employees;
