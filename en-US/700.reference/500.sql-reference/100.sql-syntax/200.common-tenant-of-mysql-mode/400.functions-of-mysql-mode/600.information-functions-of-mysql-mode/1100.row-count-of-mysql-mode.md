# ROW_COUNT

## Syntax

```sql
ROW_COUNT()
```

## Purpose

`ROW_COUNT()` returns the number of rows that are affected by the executed SQL statement.

`ROW_COUNT` returns different values based on the statements:

* DDL statements: `0` is returned.

* DML statements other than `SELECT`: The number of affected rows is returned.

   Note that if an `UPDATE` statement is executed, the number of actually updated rows is returned.

* `SELECT` statement: If the execution result of the `SELECT` statement is a set, `-1` is returned. If the execution of the `SELECT` statement affects the row status, the number of affected rows is returned.

   For example, if the `SELECT .... INTO` statement is executed, the number of inserted rows is returned.

## Examples

```sql
obclient> INSERT INTO t VALUES(1),(2),(3);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.02 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

obclient> SELECT ROW_COUNT();
+-------------+
| ROW_COUNT() |
+-------------+
|           3 |
+-------------+
1 row in set
```
