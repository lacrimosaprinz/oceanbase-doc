# CREATE RESTORE POINT

## Purpose

You can use this statement to create a restore point. By using this feature, you can retain a data snapshot of the current moment and later perform queries based on this data snapshot. Currently, rolling back data to this restore point is not supported.

After creating a restore point, you can query the `SNAPSHOT` value of this restore point in the `V$RESTORE_POINT` view, and then retrieve the values in the data snapshot using the syntax `SELECT * FROM table_name AS OF SNAPSHOT snapshot;`.

  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p><ul><li>OceanBase Database V4.x does not support the CREATE RESTORE POINT statement. </li><li>You cannot create or drop restore points in the sys tenant. </li></ul></p>
</main>


## Limitations

The limitations for the restore point feature are as follows:

* Physical backups are not supported.

* Primary/secondary database is not supported.

* Each tenant is limited to `10` restore points.

* After you create a restore point, if DDL statements are executed on tables that existed before the creation of the restore point, the system will throw an error.

* Since the restore point functionality depends on GTS for maintaining global consistent snapshots, GTS needs to be enabled when you use restore points. 

  The SQL command to enable GTS is as follows:

  ```sql
  obclient> SET GLOBAL ob_timestamp_service='GTS';
  ```

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE RESTORE POINT restore_point;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---------------|----------|
| restore_point | The name of the restore point.  |

## Examples

1. Create a table named `test1`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE test1 (c1 INT,c2 INT);
   ```

2. Insert a row of data.

   ```sql
   obclient> INSERT INTO test1(c1,c2) values (1,1);
   ```

3. Create a restore point `rp1`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE RESTORE POINT rp1;
   ```

4. Insert additional data into the `test1` table and commit these data.

   ```sql
   obclient> INSERT INTO test1(c1,c2) values (2, 2),(3,3);
   obclient> commit;
   ```

5. Query the current version of data in the `test1` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM test1;
   +------+------+
   | c1   | c2   |
   +------+------+
   |    1 |    1 |
   |    2 |    2 |
   |    3 |    3 |
   +------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

6. View the information of the created restore point `rp1` and query the historical versions of data based on the version number.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM V$RESTORE_POINT;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-----------+------------------+----------------------------+------+
   | TENANT_ID | SNAPSHOT         | TIME                       | NAME |
   +-----------+------------------+----------------------------+------+
   |      1001 | 1630407064663511 | 2021-08-31 18:51:04.665692 | rp1  |
   +-----------+------------------+----------------------------+------+
   1 row in set

   obclient> SELECT * FROM test1 AS OF SNAPSHOT 1630407064663511;
   +------+------+
   | c1   | c2   |
   +------+------+
   |    1 |    1 |
   +------+------+
   1 row in set
   ```
