## Purpose

You can use this statement to create an OceanBase Database user. After you create a user, you can use it to connect to OceanBase Database.
  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>To execute this statement, you must have the global <code>CREATE USER</code> privilege. </p>
  </main>

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS] user_specification_list
    [REQUIRE {NONE | SSL | X509 | tls_option}];

user_specification_list:
    user_specification [, user_specification ...]

user_specification:
    user IDENTIFIED BY  'authstring'
  | user IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD 'hashstring'

tls_option:
 | CIPHER 'cipher'
 | ISSUER 'issuer'
 | SUBJECT 'subject'
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| IF NOT EXISTS | If the username already exists and `IF NOT EXISTS` is not specified, an error is returned.  |
| user_name | The username. For each user created, a new entry is created in the `mysql.user` table. If the username already exists, an error is returned.  |
| IDENTIFIED BY | You can use the optional `IDENTIFIED BY` clause to specify a password for the account. If the password contains special characters ~!@#%^&*_-+=`\|(){}[]:;',.?/, it must be enclosed in double quotation marks.  |
| user_name \[, user_name ...\] | Multiple usernames must be separated with commas (,).  |
| REQUIRE | The encryption protocol for the user. Valid values: `NONE`, `SSL`, `X509`, and `tls_option`.  |
| user IDENTIFIED BY  'authstring' | The password is in plaintext. After it is saved to the `mysql.user` table, the server stores it in ciphertext.  |
| user IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD 'authstring' | The password is in ciphertext. It is the password stored in the `mysql.user` table in ciphertext.  |

## Examples

1. Create users named `sqluser01` and `sqluser02`, and specify passwords in plaintext.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE USER 'sqluser01' IDENTIFIED BY '******', 'sqluser02' IDENTIFIED BY '******';
   ```

2. Create a user named `sqluser03` and specify a password in ciphertext.

   ```shell
   // Query the password in ciphertext.
   obclient> SELECT PASSWORD FROM mysql.user;
   obclient> CREATE USER 'sqluser03' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '******************';
   ```

3. Query the users that you created.

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT user FROM mysql.user;
   +-----------+
   | user      |
   +-----------+
   | root      |
   | admin     |
   | sqluser01 |
   | sqluser02 |
   | sqluser03 |
   +-----------+
   5 rows in set
   ```
