# CREATE VIEW

## Purpose

You can use this statement to create a view. If the `OR REPLACE` clause is specified, this statement can replace the existing view.

In a database, views do not exist as tables, but are derived from the execution results of the `SELECT` statement specified in the `CREATE VIEW` statement. A view is derived each time the statement is used.

If the `FROM` clause references two or more tables or views, the view is called a join view. An updatable join view, also known as a modifiable join view, involves two or more base tables or views and allows DML operations. Updatable views are not limited by the `WITH READ ONLY` clause.

A view must meet several criteria to be updatable. For example, a general rule is that an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation on a join view can modify only one base table at a time.

## Syntax

```sql
create_view_stmt:
  CREATE [OR REPLACE] VIEW view_name [(column_name_list)] AS select_stmt;

column_name_list:
    column_name [, column_name ...]
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OR REPLACE | Specifies to re-create a view that already exists by using a new definition.  |
| view_name | The name of the view.  |
| select_stmt | A `SELECT` statement that defines a view. You can use this statement to query base tables or other views.  |
| column_name_list | The column names in the view, which must be unique, like those in a base table. By default, the column names retrieved by the `SELECT` statement are used as the column names in the view. You can also use the optional `column_name_list` clause to define column names for a view. Separate multiple column names with commas (,). The number of column names in `column_name_list` must be equal to the number of columns retrieved by the `SELECT` statement. The `SELECT` statement can directly reference the columns of a table. You can also use functions, constants, and operators in the statement to retrieve columns.  |

## Examples

Select columns `c1` and `c2` from table `t` to create view `v`.

```sql
obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v(vc1, vc2) AS SELECT c1, c2 FROM t;
```
