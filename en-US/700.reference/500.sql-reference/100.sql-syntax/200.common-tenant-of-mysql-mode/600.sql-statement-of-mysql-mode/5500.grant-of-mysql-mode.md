# GRANT

## Purpose

You can use this statement to grant privileges to other users as the system administrator.

## Required privileges

* To execute the `GRANT` statement, you need to have the granted privilege. For example, if user `user1` wants to grant the `SELECT` privilege on table `tbl1` to user `user2`, then user `user1` must have the `SELECT` privilege on table `tbl1`.

* To execute the `GRANT` statement, you need to have the `GRANT OPTION` privilege. For more information on privileges in OceanBase Database, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md).

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>After you grant privileges to a user, the user needs to reconnect to OceanBase Database for the privileges to take effect.</p>
</main>

## Syntax

```sql
GRANT {priv_type [, priv_type...]} 
    ON priv_level 
    TO {user [, user...]} 
    [WITH GRANT OPTION]

user:
      user_name
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] BY password 
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] BY PASSWORD password
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| priv_type | Specifies the type of privilege to be granted. Multiple privileges can be granted by separating them with a comma (`,`). For specific privilege types and their explanations, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md). |
| priv_level | Specifies the level at which the privileges are granted. It can be specified to take effect on all databases and tables (`*.*`), on a specified database or specified table (`db_name.*`, `*.table_name`), or on a specific table in a specific database (`db_name.table_name`). |
| user | Specifies the user or users to whom the privileges are granted. Multiple users can be specified by separating them with a comma (`,`). If the user does not exist, the statement will create the user directly. |
| auth_plugin | Specifies the method of user authentication. Currently, only the `mysql_native_password` authentication plugin is supported. |
| BY password | Specifies a plaintext password for the user to be granted, which will be stored as encrypted in the `mysql.user` table on the server. If the password contains special characters <code>~!@#%^&*_-+=`\|(){}[]:;',.?/</code>, it should be enclosed in English quotes (`''` or `""`). |
| BY PASSWORD password | Specifies an encrypted password for the user to be granted, which will be directly stored in the `mysql.user` table. |
| WITH GRANT OPTION | Specifies whether the privilege is allowed to be granted to others and cascaded when revoking the grant. |

## Examples

* Grant the `CREATE VIEW` privilege on database `db1` to the existing user `user1` and set to allow granting the same privilege to other users.
  
  ```shell
  obclient> GRANT CREATE VIEW ON db1.* TO user1 WITH GRANT OPTION;
  ```

* Grant the `CREATE` privilege on database `db1` to the existing user `user1` and change the password for `user1`.
  
  ```shell
  obclient> GRANT CREATE ON db1.* TO user1 IDENTIFIED BY '********';
  ```
  
  After execution, check the password for the user `user1` in the `mysql.user` table to see that it has been updated to the newly set password.

* Grant the `CREATE` privilege on database `db1` to the non-existing user `user2` and set a password for `user2`.
  
  ```shell
  obclient> GRANT CREATE ON db1.* TO user2 IDENTIFIED BY '********';
  ```
