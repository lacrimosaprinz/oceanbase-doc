# GRANT

## Purpose

You can use a `GRANT` statement to grant privileges to other users as the system administrator.

## Required privileges

* To execute the `GRANT` statement, you need to have the granted privilege. For example, if user `user1` wants to grant the `SELECT` privilege on table `tbl1` to user `user2`, then user `user1` must have the `SELECT` privilege on table `tbl1`.

* To execute the `GRANT` statement, you need to have the `GRANT OPTION` privilege. For more information on privileges in OceanBase Database, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md).

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>After you grant privileges to a user, the user needs to reconnect to OceanBase Database for the privileges to take effect.</p>
</main>

## Syntax

```sql
GRANT {priv_type [, priv_type...]}
    ON priv_level
    TO {user [, user...]}
    [WITH GRANT OPTION]

user:
      user_name
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] BY password
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] BY PASSWORD password
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| priv_type | The type of the privilege to be granted. To grant multiple privileges to a user, separate the privileges with commas (`,`). For information about privilege types and their description, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md).  |
| priv_level | The level of the privilege to be granted. You can specify that the privilege takes effect on all databases and all tables (`*.*`), a specified database or table (`db_name.*` or `*.table_name`), or a specific table in a specific database (`db_name.table_name`).  |
| user | The user to which the privilege is granted. To grant privileges to multiple users, separate the usernames with commas (`,`). If the specified user does not exist, the statement creates the user directly.  |
| auth_plugin | The user authentication method. Currently, only the `mysql_native_password` authentication plug-in is supported.  |
| BY password | The password for the user to be authorized. The password is in plaintext and is saved in ciphertext on the server after it is saved to the `mysql.user` table. Enclose special characters in the password in quotation marks (<code>''</code> or <code>""</code>). Special characters include the following ones: <code>~!@#%^&*_-+=`\|(){}[]:;',.?/</code>.  |
| BY PASSWORD password | The password for the user to be authorized. The password is in ciphertext and is saved to the `mysql.user` table directly.  |
| WITH GRANT OPTION | Specifies whether to enable privilege delegation. When privilege delegation is enabled, grant revocation extends to dependent users.  |

## Examples

* Grant the `CREATE VIEW` privilege on the `db1` database to the `user1` user and enable privilege delegation.

   ```shell
   obclient> GRANT CREATE VIEW ON db1.* TO user1 WITH GRANT OPTION;
   ```

* Grant the `CREATE` privilege on the `db1` database to the `user1` user and change the password for `user1`.

   ```shell
   obclient> GRANT CREATE ON db1.* TO user1 IDENTIFIED by '********';
   ```

   After executing the statement, check the password of `user1` in the `mysql.user` table. The password is updated to the newly set one.

* Grant the `CREATE` privilege on the `db1` database to a non-existing user named `user2` and set the password for `user2`.

   ```shell
   obclient> GRANT CREATE ON db1.* TO user2 IDENTIFIED by '********';
   ```
