# HELP

## Purpose

You can use this statement to return the search results in the help table. The search string can contain percent signs (`%`) and underscores (`_`).

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You must perform the following steps to load <code>help tables</code> before you can use the <code>HELP</code> statement:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Copy the <code>fill_help_tables-ob.sql</code> file to the <code>tmp</code> directory of the client. </li>
    <li>Log on to the sys tenant and execute the <code>source /tmp/fill_help_tables-ob.sql</code> statement. </li>
    </ol>
  </main>

The search string can match a category or one or more topics.

* Query the list of top-level help categories:

   ```sql
   HELP 'contents';
   ```

* Query the topics of a help category. For example, search for `data types`:

   ```sql
   HELP 'data_types';
   ```

* Use one or more associated keywords to query a specific help topic:

   ```sql
   HELP 'create table'
   ```

   The query results contain the following information:
   * `name`: the name of the topic.

   * `description`: the descriptive help text for the topic.

## Syntax

```sql
HELP 'search_string';

search_string:
   contents | data_types | theme
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| contents | Queries the directories of all help information. You can further search for help information by directory name.  |
| data_types | Queries the help information of a specified data type.  |

## Examples

   ```sql
   obclient> HELP 'contents';
   You asked for help about help category: "Contents"
   For more information, type 'help <item>', where <item> is one of the following
   categories:
      Data Types
      Functions
      Operator
      Escape character
      Data Definition
      Data Manipulation
      Transaction Statements
      Prepared Statements
      Compound Statements
      Administration
      Utility
   ```

* Query the numeric data types.

   ```sql
   obclient> HELP 'Numeric Types';
   You asked for help about help category: "Numeric Types"
   For more information, type 'help <item>', where <item> is one of the following
   topics:
      TINYINT
      BOOL,BOOLEAN
      SMALLINT
      MEDIUMINT
      INT
      INTEGER
      BIGINT
      FLOAT
      DOUBLE
      DOUBLE PRECISION
      FLOAT(p)
      DECIMAL
      NUMERIC
   ```

* Query the method for using the `KILL` statement.

   ```sql
   obclient> HELP 'KILL';
   Name: 'KILL'
   Description:

     Syntax:

     KILL [GLOBAL | LOCAL] [CONNECTION | QUERY] 'sessionid'

     Each connection to OceanBase Database runs in an independent thread. You can use the SHOW PROCESSLIST statement to query the ongoing threads and use the KILL thread_id statement to terminate a thread.

   • KILL CONNECTION terminates the connection with the specified thread ID, like the KILL statement without a modifier.

   • KILL QUERY terminates the ongoing statement of the connection but retains the current status of the connection.
   If you have the PROCESS privilege, you can view all threads. If you have the SUPER privilege, you can terminate all threads and statements. Otherwise, you can view and terminate only your own threads and statements.
   ```

* Query the syntax of the `SELECT` statement.

   ```sql
   obclient> HELP SELECT
   Name: 'SELECT'
   Description:

     You can use this statement to query data from a table.

     Basic queries

     Syntax:

     SELECT
       [ALL | DISTINCT]
         selectexpr [AS othername] [, selectexpr ...]
         [FROM table_references]
           [WHERE where_conditions]
       [GROUP BY group_by_list]
       [HAVING search_conditions]
       [ORDER BY order_list]
       [LIMIT {[offset,] rowcount | rowcount OFFSET offset}]
           [FOR UPDATE];
   ```
