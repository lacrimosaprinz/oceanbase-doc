<main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>In the current version of OceanBase Database, the <code>LOCK TABLES</code> statement is ignored in MySQL mode. </p>
</main>


  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>Currently, OceanBase Database Community Edition does not support <code>LOCK TABLES</code>. </p>
  </main>

## Syntax

```sql
LOCK TABLES
    table_name [ [AS] alias ] lock_type
    [, table_name [ [AS] alias ] lock_type ]...

lock_type:
    READ [LOCAL]  
  | [LOW_PRIORTY] WRITE
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| table_name | The name of the table to be locked.  |
| lock_type | The lock type. The current version of OceanBase Database supports the following lock types:<ul> <li> `READ`: allows all sessions, including the session that applies the lock, to read the locked table but not to modify it. </li> <li> `READ LOCAL`: functions in the same way as `READ`, but allows execution of the `INSERT` statement. </li> <li> `WRITE`: allows the current session to read and modify the locked table, but blocks all access from other sessions. </li> <li> `LOW_PRIORITY WRITE`: applies low-priority write locks. </li></ul> |
|  |

## Examples

Set a read lock for the `test1` table and a write lock for the `test2` table.

```sql
obclient> LOCK TABLES test1 as t1 READ LOCAL, test2 as t2 LOW_PRIORITY WRITE;
Query OK, 0 row affected
```
