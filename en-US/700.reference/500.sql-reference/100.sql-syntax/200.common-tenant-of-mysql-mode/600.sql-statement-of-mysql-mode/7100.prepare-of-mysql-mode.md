## Purpose

You can use this statement to prepare and name a statement for future reference. You can use `EXECUTE` to execute the prepared statement and use `DEALLOCATE PREPARE` to release the statement.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>The prepared statement takes effect only in the current session and does not apply to other sessions. When the session ends, the prepared statement no longer exists. </li>
    <li>If the prepared statement created in a stored routine is global, it is not released after the program is executed. However, the prepared statement in the context of the stored program cannot reference the parameters or local variables of the stored procedure or function; otherwise, the statement cannot be executed outside the program. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>

## Syntax

```sql
PREPARE stmt_name FROM preparable_stmt
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------|------------------|
| stmt_name | The name of the statement to be prepared. The statement name is case-insensitive.  |
| preparable_stmt | The SQL statement to be executed. This parameter is a string literal or a user variable that contains the text of the SQL statement. The text must represent a single statement, rather than multiple statements.  |

```sql
/* Use the SELECT statement to generate a prepared statement. */
obclient> PREPARE stmt1 FROM 'SELECT SQRT(POW(?,2) + POW(?,2)) AS hypotenuse';
Query OK, 0 rows affected

/* Set the user variables a and b. */
obclient> SET @a = 3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SET @b = 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
