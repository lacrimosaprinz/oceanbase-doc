# SAVEPOINT

## Purpose

You can use this statement to create a savepoint in a transaction to partially roll back the transaction.

## Syntax

* Create a savepoint:

   ```sql
   SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
   ```

* Roll back a transaction to a savepoint:

   ```sql
   ROLLBACK [WORK] TO [SAVEPOINT] savepoint_name;
   ```

* Release a savepoint:

   ```sql
   RELEASE SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
   ```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \[WORK\] | An optional keyword that does not affect the semantics.  |
| savepoint_name | The name of the savepoint. The specified savepoint is unique within the transaction. Only the latest one of the savepoints with the same name is retained. After you create a savepoint, you can roll back the transaction to the specified savepoint or use the `ROLLBACK` statement to roll back the entire transaction.  |

## Examples

Assume that you have executed the statements in the following table for a transaction.

| **sql_no** | **Statement** | **Partition** |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | UPDATE ...; | p1, p4 |
|            | SAVEPOINT sp1; |            |
| 2 | UPDATE ...; | p2, p4 |
| 3 | UPDATE ...; | p3, p5 |
|            | SAVEPOINT sp2; |            |
| 4 | UPDATE ...; | p1, p3, p6 |
| 5 | UPDATE ...; | p1, p5 |
|            | SAVEPOINT sp3; |            |
| 6 | SELECT ...; |            |
| 7 | UPDATE ...; | p5, p6 |
|            | SAVEPOINT sp4; |            |

### Record savepoints

You can create savepoints before committing the transaction. You must create a linked list of savepoints based on the order in which they are created. The preceding transaction contains seven SQL statements and four savepoints. The following figure shows the linked list of savepoints. Each node records the mapping of `<savepoint_name, sql_no>`.

### Participant partition list of a transaction

To enable the rollback of all modifications made after an SQL statement was executed, the system records the involved partitions and the corresponding `sql_no` values. The preceding transaction has executed seven SQL statements, involving six partitions, which are partitions `p1` to `p6`.

### Roll back a transaction to a savepoint

1. Query the `sql_no` value corresponding to `savepoint_name` based on the linked list of savepoints.

   Assume that you need to execute `ROLLBACK to SAVEPOINT sp2`. It can be learned from the linked list of savepoints that the `sql_no` value corresponding to `sp2` is `3`.

2. Query the partition corresponding to the `sql_no` value based on the participant partition list of the transaction.

   It can be learned from the participant partition list of the transaction that statements with a `sql_no` greater than `3` are executed on partitions `p1`, `p3`, `p5`, and `p6`.

3. When rolling back partition data, the scheduler initiates rollback requests to the partitions determined in **Step 2** to roll back all the modifications made by this transaction on these partitions after `sp2`.

   Some modifications made by this transaction on `p1`, `p3`, and `p5` are rolled back, and all modifications made by this transaction on `p6` are rolled back.

4. Update the participant partition list of the transaction.

   Delete `sql_no` values greater than `3` from the participant partition list of the transaction. All modifications on `p6` are rolled back. Therefore, `p6` can be deleted from the list.

5. Release invalid savepoints.

   After you execute `ROLLBACK to SAVEPOINT sp2`, the system releases savepoints `sp3` and `sp4`. The transaction can no longer be rolled back to `sp3` or `sp4`.
