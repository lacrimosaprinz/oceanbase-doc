## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| ALL \| DISTINCT \| UNIQUE \| SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS | A database table may contain duplicate values.  <ul><li> `DISTINCT` \| `UNIQUE`: Only distinct rows are listed in the query result. </li>   <li> `ALL`: All rows are listed in the query result. The default value is `ALL`.   </li>   <li>  `SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS`: In a query with the `LIMIT` clause, all returned rows are recorded, and the `FOUND_ROWS()` function executed subsequently can obtain all the rows. </li></ul> |
| select_expr | The expressions or column names that you want to query. Multiple values must be separated with commas (,). You can also use an asterisk (*) to represent all columns.  |
| AS othername | Renames the output fields.  |
| FROM table_references | The table or tables from which data is to be retrieved (multi-table query is supported).  |
| WHERE where_conditions | A filter condition, which is optional. Only the data that meets the condition is included in the query result. `where_conditions` is an expression.  |
| GROUP BY group_by_list | Summarizes data by class.  |
| WITH ROLLUP | Summarizes groups to produce higher-level aggregations, also known as hyper-aggregations, and additional rows.  |
| HAVING search_conditions | The `HAVING` clause is similar to the `WHERE` clause, but the `HAVING` clause can use an accumulation function such as `SUM` or `AVG`.  |
| SAMPLE \[BLOCK\] \[ ALL \| BASE \| INCR\] (sample_percent) | Scans only some records.  <ul><li> `BLOCK` indicates that random data blocks are scanned. By default, random rows are scanned.    </li>   <li>  `ALL` indicates that all data is scanned. The default value is `ALL`.    </li>   <li>  `BASE` indicates that baseline data is scanned.    </li>   <li>  `INCR` indicates that incremental data is scanned.    </li>   <li>  `sample_percent` indicates the sampling ratio, in %. It supports the `INTEGER` and `DECIMAL` data types.   </li></ul> |
| SEED integer | The sampling seed. Value range: [0, 4294967295]. The same result is always returned for the same seed.  |
| {USE \| FORCE \| IGNORE} {KEY \| INDEX} \[FOR {JOIN \| ORDER BY \| GROUP BY}\] (index_list) | Specifies whether to use the specified index for the query.  <ul><li> `USE` indicates that an index is used for a specific operation.    </li>   <li>  `FORCE` indicates that indexes are forcibly used for some operations.    </li>   <li>  `IGNORE` indicates that no index is used for a specific operation.    </li>   <li>  `FOR JOIN` indicates that indexes are joined.    </li>   <li>  `FOR ORDER BY` indicates that indexes are sorted.    </li>   <li>  `FOR GROUP BY` indicates that indexes are grouped. </li></ul> |
| SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS | Displays the query results in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. The default value is `ASC`.  |
| \[LIMIT {\[offset,\] row_count \|row_count OFFSET offset}\] | Forces the `SELECT` statement to return the specified number of records. `LIMIT` supports one or two numeric arguments. The arguments must be integer constants.  <ul><li> Given two arguments, the first argument specifies the offset of the first record row to be returned, and the second argument specifies the maximum number of record rows to be returned. The offset of the initial record row is 0.    </li>   <li>  Given one argument, the argument specifies the maximum number of record rows to be returned, and the offset is 0.  </li></ul> |
| FOR UPDATE | Imposes an exclusive lock on all the rows in the query results to prevent other concurrent transactions from changing or reading the rows in some transaction isolation levels.  <ul><li> `WAIT`: indicates the time for waiting for other transactions to release resources, in seconds. If the time expires, the system returns a failure of obtaining resources.    </li>   <li>  `NOWAIT` \| `NO_WAIT`: indicates that the system does not wait for other transactions to release resources, but directly returns a failure of obtaining resources.   </li></ul> |
| PARTITION(partition_list) | The partitions from which data is selected in the table. For example, you can set this parameter to `PARTITION(p0,p1â€¦)`.  |
| dblink_name | The DBLink used to query data from tables in a remote database. <main id="notice" ><h4>Note</h4><p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition does not support the <code>DBLink</code> feature. </p></main> |
| LOCK IN SHARE MODE | Locks query results.  |

## Examples

### Simple table queries

Take table `a` as an example.

![](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/EN_US/7.reference/4.development-reference/Select-sample.jpg)

* Query the data in the `name` column from table `a`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT name FROM a;
   +------+
   | name |
   +------+
   | a    |
   | b    |
   | a    |
   +------+
   ```

* Deduplicate the query results of the `name` column.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT DISTINCT name FROM a;
   +------+
   | name |
   +------+
   | a    |
   | b    |
   +------+
   ```

* Query the `id`, `name`, and `num` values from table `a`, divide the `num` values by 2, and name the output column as `avg`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT id, name, num/2 AS avg FROM a;
   +------+------+----------+
   | id   | name | avg      |
   +------+------+----------+
   |    1 | a    |  50.0000 |
   |    2 | b    | 100.0000 |
   |    3 | a    |  25.0000 |
   +------+------+----------+
   ```

* Return the values of the corresponding `id`, `name`, and `num` fields based on the filtering condition `name = 'a'`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT id, name, num FROM a WHERE name = 'a';
   +------+------+------+
   | id   | name | num  |
   +------+------+------+
   |    1 | a    |  100 |
   |    3 | a    |   50 |
   +------+------+------+
   ```

* Query the `id` and `name` values from table `a`, calculate the sum of the `num` values by `name`, and return the calculation results.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT id, name, SUM(num) FROM a GROUP BY name;
   +------+------+----------+
   | id   | name | SUM(num) |
   +------+------+----------+
   |    1 | a    |      150 |
   |    2 | b    |      200 |
   +------+------+----------+
   ```

* Query the `id` and `name` values from table `a`, calculate the sum of the `num` values by `name`, and return the rows with a sum of less than `160`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT id, name, SUM(num) as sum FROM a GROUP BY name HAVING SUM(num) < 160;
   +------+------+------+
   | id   | name | sum  |
   +------+------+------+
   |    1 | a    |  150 |
   +------+------+------+
   ```

* Query the `id`, `name`, and `num` values from table `a`, and sort the result set by the `num` column in `ASC` order.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM a ORDER BY num ASC;
   +------+------+------+
   | id   | name | num  |
   +------+------+------+
   |    3 | a    |   50 |
   |    1 | a    |  100 |
   |    2 | b    |  200 |
   +------+------+------+
   ```

* Query the `id`, `name`, and `num` values from table `a`, and sort the result set by the `num` column in `DESC` order.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM a ORDER BY num DESC;
   +------+------+------+
   | id   | name | num  |
   +------+------+------+
   |    2 | b    |  200 |
   |    1 | a    |  100 |
   |    3 | a    |   50 |
   +------+------+------+
   ```

* Query the `id`, `name`, and `num` values from table `a`, and use `LIMIT` to forcibly return two result rows starting from the second row.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM a LIMIT 1,2;
   +------+------+------+
   | id   | name | num  |
   +------+------+------+
   |    2 | b    |  200 |
   |    3 | a    |   50 |
   +------+------+------+
   ```

* You can use the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` statement to apply a row lock to a table. If you use the `LIMIT 1` clause, the operator is pushed down to the table scan step during query optimization, and only the rows returned by `LIMIT` are locked.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM a LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE;
   ```

* If you use the `ORDER BY` clause, the query results are sorted first, and the `LIMIT 1` clause is executed. In this case, all the selected rows are locked.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM a ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE;
   ```

* Use the `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` option to lock the query results of the `a` table.

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT * FROM a LOCK IN SHARE MODE;
   +------+------+------+
   | id   | name | num  |
   +------+------+------+
   |    1 | a    |  100 |
   |    2 | b    |  200 |
   |    3 | a    |  50 |
   +------+------+------+
   3 row in set
   ```

### Queries using a DBLink

* Read the `number_t` table in the remote `test` database.

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT * FROM number_t@ob_dblink;
   +--------+-------------+---------+---------------------+--------------------------------+
   | c_int  | c_bigint    | c_float |    c_double         |   c_decimal                    |
   +--------+-------------+---------+---------------------+--------------------------------+
   | 214748 | 92233720368 | 3.40282 | 1.7976931348623157  | 123456789123456789.1234567890  |
   +--------+-------------+---------+---------------------+--------------------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* Read the `number_t` table in the remote `test` database and join the table with the local `number_t` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT a.c_decimal, b.c_double FROM number_t a, number_t@ob_dblink b where a.c_int = b.c_int;
   +--------------------------------+---------------------+
   |   c_decimal                    |    c_double         |
   +---------------------+--------------------------------+
   | 123456789123456789.1234567890  |  1.7976931348623157 |
   +---------------------+--------------------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* Read the `datetime_t` table in the remote `mysql` database.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM mysql.datetime_t@ob_dblink;
   +-------------+------------+---------+----------------------+----------------------+
   | c_date      | c_time     | c_year  | c_datetime           |  c_timestamp         |
   +-------------+------------+---------+-----------------------+---------------------+
   |  2023-04-13 | 12:12:12   |  2078   | 2100-11-01 12:12:13  | 2100-12-01 21:14:15  |
   +-------------+------------+---------+----------------------+----------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```
