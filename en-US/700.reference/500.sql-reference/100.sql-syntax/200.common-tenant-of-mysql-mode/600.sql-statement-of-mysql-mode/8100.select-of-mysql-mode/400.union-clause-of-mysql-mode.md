# UNION clause

## Purpose

You can use this statement to perform the `UNION`, `EXCEPT`, or `INTERSECT` operation on the query results of the `SELECT` statement.

## Syntax

```sql
select_clause_set:
    select_clause_set_left [ UNION | UNION ALL | MINUS | EXCEPT | INTERSECT] select_clause_set_right
  [sort_list_columns] [limit_clause]
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| select_clause_set_left | The `SELECT` statement that returns the left set used for set calculation.  |
| select_clause_set_right | The `SELECT` statement that returns the right set used for set calculation.  |
| sort_list_columns | The grouping method to be used after the set calculation.  |
| limit_clause | The number of rows to be returned after the set calculation.  |
| UNION ALL | Combines the results of two queries.  |
| UNION | Combines the results of two queries and removes the duplicates.  |
| MINUS \| EXCEPT | Returns unique rows from the result set of the query on the left side of the operator that do not exist in the result set of the query on the right side.<br>  **Note**: `MINUS` is a synonym for `EXCEPT`.  |
| INTERSECT | Returns unique rows that exist in the result sets of both the query on the left side and the one on the right side of the operator.  |

## Examples

Take the following two tables as an example:

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
obclient> CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, -1), (2, -2);
obclient> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1, 1), (2, -2), (3, 3);
```

* Query all records of dataset `t1`∪`t2`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 UNION ALL SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
   +------+------+
   | c1   | c2   |
   +------+------+
   |    1 |   -1 |
   |    2 |   -2 |
   |    1 |    1 |
   |    2 |   -2 |
   |    3 |    3 |
   +------+------+
   5 rows in set
   ```

* Query all unique records of dataset `t1`∪`t2`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 UNION SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
   +------+------+
   | c1   | c2   |
   +------+------+
   |    1 |   -1 |
   |    2 |   -2 |
   |    1 |    1 |
   |    3 |    3 |
   +------+------+
   4 rows in set  
   ```

* Query the intersection of `t1` and `t2`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 INTERSECT SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
   +------+------+
   | c1   | c2   |
   +------+------+
   |    2 |   -2 |
   +------+------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* Query the records that exist in only one of `t1` and `t2`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 EXCEPT SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2;
   +------+------+
   | c1   | c2   |
   +------+------+
   |    1 |   -1 |
   +------+------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* Query the first two rows sorted in descending order by `c2` in the union of `t1` and `t2`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT c1, c2 FROM t1 UNION SELECT c1, c2 FROM t2 ORDER BY c2 DESC LIMIT 2;
   +------+------+
   | c1   | c2   |
   +------+------+
   |    3 |    3 |
   |    1 |    1 |
   +------+------+
   2 rows in set
   ```
