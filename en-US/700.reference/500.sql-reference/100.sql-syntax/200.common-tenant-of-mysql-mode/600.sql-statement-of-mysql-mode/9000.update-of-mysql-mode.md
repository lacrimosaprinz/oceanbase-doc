# UPDATE

## Purpose

You can use this statement to modify the field values in a table.

## Syntax

```sql
UPDATE [IGNORE] table_references
    SET update_asgn_list
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [ORDER BY order_list]
    [LIMIT row_count];

table_references:
    table_name [PARTITION (partition_name,...)] [, ...]

update_asgn_list:
    column_name = expr [, ...]

order_list:
    column_name [ASC|DESC] [, column_name [ASC|DESC]...]
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| IGNORE | Ignores errors that occur during the execution of an `INSERT` statement.  |
| table_references | The name of the table to be modified. Multiple table names must be separated with commas (,).  |
| where_condition | The filter condition.  |
| row_count | The maximum number of rows.  |
| table_name | The name of the table into which the data is inserted.  |
| partition_name | The name of the partition to which the data is inserted.  |
| column_name | The name of the column.  |
| ASC | Sorts column names in ascending order.  |
| DESC | Sorts column names in descending order.  |

## Considerations

Direct UPDATE operations on subqueries are not supported for either a single table or multiple tables. Otherwise, an error occurs. Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> UPDATE (SELECT * FROM T1) SET C1 = 100;
ERROR 1288 (HY000): The target table  of the UPDATE is not updatable
```

## Examples

1. Create tables `t1` and `t2`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  1 |    1 |
   |  2 |    2 |
   |  3 |    3 |
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   4 rows in set

   obclient> CREATE TABLE t2(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT) PARTITION BY KEY(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  5 |    5 |
   |  1 |    1 |
   |  2 |    2 |
   |  3 |    3 |
   +----+------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

2. For the row where `t1.c1 = 1` in the `t1` table, set its value in the `c2` column to `100`.

   ```sql
   obclient> UPDATE t1 SET t1.c2 = 100 WHERE t1.c1 = 1;
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  1 |  100 |
   |  2 |    2 |
   |  3 |    3 |
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

3. For the first two rows sorted by column `c2` in table `t1`, set their values in column `c2` to `100`.

   ```sql
   obclient> UPDATE t1 SET t1.c2 = 100 ORDER BY c2 LIMIT 2;
   Query OK, 2 rows affected
   Rows matched: 2  Changed: 2  Warnings: 0

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  1 |  100 |
   |  2 |  100 |
   |  3 |    3 |
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

4. In partition `p2` of table `t2`, for rows where `t2.c1 > 2`, set their values in column `c2` to `100`.

   ```sql
   obclient> UPDATE t2 PARTITION(p2) SET t2.c2 = 100 WHERE t2.c1 > 2;
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  5 |    5 |
   |  1 |    1 |
   |  2 |    2 |
   |  3 |  100 |
   +----+------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

5. Update multiple tables. For rows where `t1.c1 = t2.c1`, set their values in column `c2` of table `t1` to `100` and set their values in column `c2` of table `t2` to `200`.

   ```sql
   obclient> UPDATE t1,t2 SET t1.c2 = 100, t2.c2 = 200 WHERE t1.c2 = t2.c2;
   Query OK, 6 rows affected
   Rows matched: 6  Changed: 6  Warnings: 0

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  1 |  100 |
   |  2 |  100 |
   |  3 |  100 |
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   4 rows in set

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  5 |    5 |
   |  1 |  200 |
   |  2 |  200 |
   |  3 |  200 |
   +----+------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

6. Update multiple tables. For rows where `t1.c1 = t2.c1`, set their values in column `c2` in partition `p2` of table `t1` to `100` and set their values in column `c2` in partition `p2` of table `t2` to `200`.

   ```sql
   obclient> UPDATE t1,t2 PARTITION(p2) SET t1.c2 = 100, t2.c2 = 200 WHERE t1.c2 = t2.c2;
   Query OK, 6 rows affected
   Rows matched: 6  Changed: 6  Warnings: 0

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  1 |  100 |
   |  2 |  100 |
   |  3 |  100 |
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   4 rows in set

   obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  5 |    5 |
   |  1 |  200 |
   |  2 |  200 |
   |  3 |  200 |
   +----+------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

7. Update an updatable view `v`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> UPDATE v SET v.c2 = 100 WHERE v.c1 = 1;
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

   obclient> SELECT * FROM v;
   +----+------+
   | c1 | c2   |
   +----+------+
   |  1 |  100 |
   |  2 |    2 |
   |  3 |    3 |
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   4 rows in set
   ```
