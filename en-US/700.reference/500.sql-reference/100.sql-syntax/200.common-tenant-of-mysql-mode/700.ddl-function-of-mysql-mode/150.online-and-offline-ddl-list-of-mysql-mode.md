# Online and offline DDL operations

The following table describes the online DDL operations supported by the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database V4.x.

| Type | Operation | Time spent | Remarks |
|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Index operation | Add an index | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | This operation mainly involves global indexes, local indexes, global indexes with specified partitions (supported in OceanBase Database V4.0.0 and later), and spatial indexes (supported in OceanBase Database V4.2.0 and later).  |
| Index operation | Drop an index | Related to whether active transactions exist | N/A |
| Index operation | Rename an index | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Index operation | Hybrid index operations | Related to the operation with the longest execution time | For example, `ALTER TABLE t1 ADD INDEX i4(c1), DROP INDEX i2, RENAME INDEX i1 TO i1x` involves hybrid index operations.  |
| Column operation | Add a column to the end of a table | Only for metadata modification | For example, add a `LOB` (`TEXT`) column by executing a statement similar to `ALTER TABLE tbl1 ADD c3 LOB`.  |
| Column operation | Add a `VIRTUAL` column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Drop a `VIRTUAL` column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Set a `NOT NULL` constraint on a column | Related to the data volume, because data is queried | N/A |
| Column operation | Set a `NULL` constraint on a column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Set a default value for a column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Drop the default value of a column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Change the value of an auto-increment column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Rename a column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Increase the length or precision of the data type for a column | Only for metadata modification | For example, increase the length of the `INT` type, increase the length of the `VARCHAR` type, or convert the `NUMBER` type.  |
| Column operation | Hybrid column operations | Related to the operation with the longest execution time | If an offline column operation is involved, the operation is upgraded to an offline DDL operation.  |
| Foreign key operation | Add a foreign key or a `CHECK`/`NOT NULL` constraint | Related to the data volume, because data is queried  | N/A |
| Foreign key operation | Drop a foreign key or a `CHECK`/`NOT NULL` constraint | Related to the data volume, because data is queried  | N/A |
| Table operation | Rename a table | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Table operation | Change the row format | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Table operation | Change the block size | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Table operation | Switch the compression algorithm | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Table operation | Optimize a tablespace | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Partition operation | Add a partition | Only for metadata modification | N/A |


The following table describes the offline DDL operations supported by the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database V4.x.

| Type | Operation | Time spent | Remarks |
|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Column operation | Add a column (`BEFORE`/`AFTER`/`FIRST`) | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized | This operation is not supported in Oracle mode. |
| Column operation | Reorder columns (`BEFORE`/`AFTER`/`FIRST`) | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | This operation is not supported in Oracle mode. |
| Column operation | Add an auto-increment column | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | N/A |
| Column operation | Change a column to an auto-increment column | Related to the data volume, because data is queried | N/A |
| Column operation | Change the type of a column | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | This operation is not supported in Oracle mode. |
| Column operation | Set a column as a primary key | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | N/A |
| Column operation | Add or drop a `STORED` column | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | N/A |
| Column operation | Drop a column | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | N/A |
| Column operation | Hybrid column operations | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | N/A |
| Primary key operation | Add or drop a primary key | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | N/A |
| Table operation | Truncate a table | Related to whether active transactions exist | N/A |
| Table operation | Change the character set | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | This operation is not supported in Oracle mode. |
| Table operation | Drop a table | Related to whether active transactions exist | N/A |
| Partition operation | Modify partitioning rules | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | N/A |
| Partition operation | Drop a partition | Related to whether active transactions exist | A partition-level table lock is added to the partition.  |
| Partition operation | Truncate a partition | Related to whether active transactions exist | A partition-level table lock is added to the partition.  |
