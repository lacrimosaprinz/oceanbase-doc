# Primary key operations

This topic describes simple primary key operations in the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, including adding, modifying, and dropping primary keys.

## Add a primary key

The syntax for adding a primary key is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (column_name);
```

Here, `table_name` specifies the name of the table to which the primary key is to be added, and `column_name` specifies the primary key column. For more information, see [ALTER TABLE](../600.sql-statement-of-mysql-mode/1600.alter-table-of-mysql-mode.md).

Assume that the tbl1 table already exists in the database. The following sample statement adds a primary key index to the tbl1 table and applies the index to the c1 column:

```shell
obclient> ALTER TABLE tbl1 ADD PRIMARY KEY(c1);
```

## Modify a primary key

The syntax for modifying a primary key is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PRIMARY KEY, ADD PRIMARY KEY (column_name);
```

Here, `table_name` specifies the name of the table to which the primary key belongs, and `column_name` specifies the primary key column. For more information, see [ALTER TABLE](../600.sql-statement-of-mysql-mode/1600.alter-table-of-mysql-mode.md).

Assume that the tbl1 table already exists in the database and the tbl1 table has a primary key. The following sample statement modifies the primary key in the tbl1 table and applies it to the c2 column:

```shell
obclient> ALTER TABLE tbl1 DROP PRIMARY KEY, ADD PRIMARY KEY(c2);
```

## Drop a primary key

The syntax for dropping a primary key is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PRIMARY KEY;
```

Here, `table_name` specifies the name of the table to which the primary key belongs. For more information, see [ALTER TABLE](../600.sql-statement-of-mysql-mode/1600.alter-table-of-mysql-mode.md).

Assume that the tbl1 table exists in the database and the tbl1 table has a primary key. The following sample statement drops the primary key from the tbl1 table:

```shell
obclient> ALTER TABLE tbl1 DROP PRIMARY KEY;
```
