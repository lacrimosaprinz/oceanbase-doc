# Generated column operations

The MySQL mode of OceanBase Database allows you to add a `STORED` column, modify a `STORED` column, drop a `STORED` column, add a `VIRTUAL` column, and drop a `VIRTUAL` column.

## Add a STORED column

The syntax for adding a `STORED` column is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN (column_name INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS
     (column_expression) STORED);
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT,c2 VARCHAR(50));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN (c3 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) STORED);
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
<!--Modify a STORED column

The syntax for modifying a `STORED` column is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY COLUMN column_name INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS
     (column_expression) STORED;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY COLUMN c3 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 11) STORED;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
-->

## Drop a STORED column

The syntax for dropping a `STORED` column is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN c3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Add a VIRTUAL column

The syntax for adding a `VIRTUAL` column is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS
     (column_expression) VIRTUAL;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN (c3 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) VIRTUAL);
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Drop a VIRTUAL column

The syntax for dropping a `VIRTUAL` column is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN c3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
