# Table operations

The MySQL mode of OceanBase Database allows you to change the row format, change the block size, change the character set, and rename a table.

## Change the row format

The syntax for changing the row format is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ROW_FORMAT = {DEFAULT | DYNAMIC | FIXED | COMPRESSED | REDUNDANT | COMPACT};
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 ROW_FORMAT = COMPRESSED;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Change the block size

The syntax for changing the block size is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name BLOCK_SIZE = value;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 BLOCK_SIZE = 1024;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Change the character set

The syntax for changing the character set is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET charset_name;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE test_collation CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Rename a table

The syntax for renaming a table is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE old_tbl_name RENAME TO new_tbl_name;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 RENAME TO t2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
