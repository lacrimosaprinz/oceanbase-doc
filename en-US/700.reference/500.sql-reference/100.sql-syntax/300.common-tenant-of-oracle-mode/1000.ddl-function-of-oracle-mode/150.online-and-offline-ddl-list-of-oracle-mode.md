# Online and offline DDL operations

The following table describes the online DDL operations supported by OceanBase Database V4.x in Oracle mode.

| Type | Operation | Time spent | Remarks |
|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Index operation | Add an index | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized (or rewritten) | This operation mainly involves global indexes, local indexes, global indexes with specified partitions (supported in OceanBase Database V4.0.0 and later), and spatial indexes (supported in OceanBase Database V4.2.0 and later).  |
| Index operation | Drop an index | Related to whether active transactions exist | N/A |
| Index operation | Rename an index | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Index operation | Hybrid index operations | Related to the operation with the longest execution time | For example, `ALTER TABLE t1 ADD INDEX i4(c1), DROP INDEX i2, RENAME INDEX i1 TO i1x` involves hybrid index operations.  |
| Column operation | Add a column to the end of a table | Only for metadata modification | For example, add a `LOB` (`TEXT`) column by executing a statement similar to `ALTER TABLE tbl1 ADD c3 LOB`.  |
| Column operation | Add a `VIRTUAL` column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Drop a `VIRTUAL` column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Set a `NOT NULL` constraint on a column | Related to the data volume, because data is queried | N/A |
| Column operation | Set a `NULL` constraint on a column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Set a default value for a column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Drop the default value of a column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Change the value of an auto-increment column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Rename a column | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Column operation | Increase the length or precision of the data type for a column | Only for metadata modification | For example, increase the length of the `INT` type, increase the length of the `VARCHAR` type, or convert the `NUMBER` type.  |
| Column operation | Hybrid column operations | Related to the operation with the longest execution time | If an offline column operation is involved, the operation is upgraded to an offline DDL operation.  |
| Foreign key operation | Add a foreign key or a `CHECK`/`NOT NULL` constraint | Related to the data volume, because data is queried  | N/A |
| Foreign key operation | Drop a foreign key or a `CHECK`/`NOT NULL` constraint | Related to the data volume, because data is queried  | N/A |
| Table operation | Rename a table | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Table operation | Change the row format | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Table operation | Change the block size | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Table operation | Switch the compression algorithm | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Table operation | Optimize a tablespace | Only for metadata modification | N/A |
| Partition operation | Add a partition | Only for metadata modification | N/A |


The following table describes the offline DDL operations supported by OceanBase Database V4.x in Oracle mode.

| Type | Operation | Time spent | Remarks |
|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Column operation | Add an auto-increment column | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized | N/A |
| Column operation | Set a column as a primary key | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized | N/A |
| Column operation | Add or drop a `STORED` column | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized | N/A |
| Column operation | Drop a column | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized | N/A |
| Column operation | Hybrid column operations | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized | N/A |
| Primary key operation | Add or drop a primary key | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized | N/A |
| Table operation | Truncate a table | Related to whether active transactions exist | N/A |
| Table operation | Drop a table | Related to whether active transactions exist | N/A |
| Partition operation | Modify partitioning rules | Related to the data volume, because data is reorganized | N/A |
| Partition operation | Drop a partition | Related to whether active transactions exist | A partition-level table lock is added to the partition.  |
| Partition operation | Truncate a partition | Related to whether active transactions exist | A partition-level table lock is added to the partition.  |

### Conversion rules for numeric data types

OceanBase Database stores data of different numeric data types in the same way. However, the database still provides four storage types that differ in the value range, as described in the following table.

| Storage type | Default storage rule for syntax in MySQL mode | Default storage rule for syntax in Oracle mode | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed-point DECIMAL(M,D) = {10^{-D}*i &#124; i = 0,1,...,10^M-1}, where M is a natural number and D is an integer | <ul><li> DECIMAL = DECIMAL(10, 0)</li> <li>DECIMAL(M) = DECIMAL(M, 0)</li> <li>DECIMAL(M, D): 0 <= D <= M <= 65 </li></ul> | <ul><li> DECIMAL = NUMBER(38)</li> <li> NUMBER(M) = NUMBER(38,0)</li> <li> NUMBER(M,D): M is in [1, 38] and D is in [-84,127]. </li></ul> | If and only if `D1 <= D2` and `M1-D1 <= M2-D2`, fixed-point numbers `(M1,D1)` are a subset of fixed-point numbers `(M2,D2)`.  |
| Unsigned fixed-point DECIMAL(M,D) | <ul><li> DECIMAL</li> <li> DECIMAL(M)</li> <li> DECIMAL(M,D) </li> <li>The `UNSIGNED` attribute is supported.</li></ul> | Not supported | An unsigned fixed-point number is equivalent to a non-negative fixed-point number in `DECIMAL(M,D)`. |
| Floating-point NUMBER | Not supported | NUMBER | In Oracle mode of OceanBase Database, floating-point `NUMBER` indicates floating-point numbers with a precision of 38 bits and must not be a subset of `NUMBER(M, D)`. If and only if `M-D <= 38`, `NUMBER(M, D)` is its subset.  |
| Oracle FLOAT(P) | Not supported | <ul><li>REAL = FLOAT(63) </li> <li>FLOAT = FLOAT(126)</li> <li>FLOAT(P): P is in [1, 126].</li></ul> | N/A |


The following table describes the rules for conversion between all numeric data types in OceanBase Database V4.2.0 and later. A hyphen (-) indicates a situation that involves cross-mode conversion.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <ul><li><p>Floating-point <code>NUMBER</code> and Oracle <code>FLOAT</code> exist only in Oracle mode, while unsigned fixed-point `DECIMAL(M,D)` exists only in MySQL mode. </p></li>
  <li><p>In Oracle mode, not allowing instant conversion (that modifies only the schema but does not convert data) means that conversion is not supported for non-empty tables. In MySQL mode, not allowing instant conversion means that data must be rewritten. Even if instant conversion is allowed in MySQL mode, the database does not ensure that data of all source types can be inserted into the destination type without loss. For example, lossless conversion cannot be guaranteed if you convert fixed-point numbers to Oracle <code>FLOAT</code> numbers. </p></li></ul>

| Fixed-point DECIMAL(M1,D1) | Condition for conversion: D1 <= D2 and M1-D1 <= M2-D2 | Not supported | Condition for conversion: M-D <= 38 | Condition for conversion: M1-D1 <= ceil(P*0.30103) |
| Unsigned fixed-point DECIMAL(M1,D1) | Condition for conversion: D1 <= D2 and M1-D1 <= M2-D2 | Condition for conversion: D1 <= D2 and M1-D1 <= M2-D2 | - | - |
