# Index operations

In the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database, you can create (or add), drop, and rename an index.

## Create (or add) an index

The syntax for creating (or adding) an index is as follows:

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (index_col_name,...);
```

When you create an index on a table, this table still supports read and write operations.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 VARCHAR(10));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE INDEX tbl1_idx ON tbl1 (c1, c2 ASC);
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

When you create an index in OceanBase Database, you can use the `PARALLEL` hint. The syntax for specifying a degree of parallelism (DOP) in `PARALLEL` is as follows:

```sql
CREATE /*+ PARALLEL(integer) */ INDEX index_name
     ON table_name (index_col_name,...)
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (col1 INT PRIMARY KEY, col2 VARCHAR(10));
Query OK, 0 rows affected


obclient> CREATE /*+ PARALLEL(10) */ INDEX IDX ON tbl1(col1, col2);
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Drop an index

The syntaxes for dropping an index are as follows:

```sql
DROP INDEX [schema.]index_name;
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP INDEX index_name;
```

When you drop an index from a table, this table still supports read and write operations.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> DROP INDEX tbl1_idx;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Rename an index

The syntax for renaming an index is as follows:

```sql
ALTER INDEX [ schema. ]index_name RENAME TO new_name;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER INDEX tbl1_idx RENAME TO ind1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
