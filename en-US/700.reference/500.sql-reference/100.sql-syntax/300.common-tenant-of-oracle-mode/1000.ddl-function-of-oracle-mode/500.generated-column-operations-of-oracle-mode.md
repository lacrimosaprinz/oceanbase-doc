# Generated column operations

In the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database, you can add, modify, and drop a `VIRTUAL` column.

## Add a VIRTUAL column

The syntax for adding a `VIRTUAL` column is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD (column_name [datatype ][ GENERATED ALWAYS ] AS (column_expression) [VIRTUAL]);
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT,c2 VARCHAR(50),c3 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 * 10)  VIRTUAL);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 ADD (c4 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (c1 + 1) VIRTUAL);
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Drop a VIRTUAL column

The syntax for dropping a `VIRTUAL` column is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN c3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
