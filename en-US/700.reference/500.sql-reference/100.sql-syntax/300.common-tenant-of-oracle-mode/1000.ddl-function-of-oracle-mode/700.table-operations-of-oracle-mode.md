# Table operations

In the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database, you can change the row format, block size, and name of a table.

## Change the row format

The syntax for changing the row format is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name [MOVE]
 {  NOCOMPRESS
  | COMPRESS [BASIC]
  | COMPRESS FOR OLTP
  | COMPRESS FOR QUERY [LOW | HIGH]
  | COMPRESS FOR ARCHIVE [LOW | HIGH]
  };
```

The parameters are described as follows:

* `NOCOMPRESS`: Data is not encoded or compressed, and is saved in the `flat` format.
* `COMPRESS BASIC`: Data is not encoded but is saved in the `flat` format and compressed by using the `lz4_1.0` algorithm.
* `COMPRESS FOR OLTP`: Data is not encoded but is saved in the `flat` format and compressed by using the `lz4_1.0` algorithm.
* `COMPRESS FOR QUERY [LOW | HIGH]`: Data is encoded, saved in the `encoding` format, and compressed by using the `zstd_1.0` algorithm.
* `COMPRESS FOR ARCHIVE`: Data is encoded, saved in the `encoding` format, and compressed by using the `zstd_1.0` algorithm. By default, `COMPRESS FOR ARCHIVE` is used.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 MOVE NOCOMPRESS;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Change the block size

The syntax for changing the block size is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name BLOCK_SIZE = value;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 BLOCK_SIZE = 1024;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

## Rename a table

The syntax for renaming a table is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TABLE old_tbl_name RENAME TO new_tbl_name;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE t1 RENAME TO t2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
