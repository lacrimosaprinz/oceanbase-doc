# Overview

OceanBase Database supports the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data type that complies with ECMA-404 and IETF RFC 8259.
According to the JSON standard, JSON values can be objects, arrays, numbers, strings, Boolean values (true or false), or NULL, which are all JSON data types. All values except objects and arrays are scalar values.

In JSON data types, each attribute name and string value must be enclosed in double quotation marks (").

A JSON string consists of Unicode characters escaped with backslashes (\\). JSON numbers are expressed in decimal notation. Object attributes are usually called fields, and name-value pairs of objects are usually called object members, but members sometimes may represent only attributes. Elements of a JSON array are enclosed in brackets ([ ]). Each element is an object, array, or scalar value. Multiple elements are separated with commas (,), and the elements are sorted in order.

In addition to JSON data types, a set of SQL functions can be used to create, query, and update JSON values. For more information, see [JSON functions](../../../500.functions-of-oracle-mode/200.single-row-functions-of-oracle-mode/1200.json-functions-oracle-mode/100.json-functions-overview-oracle.md).
