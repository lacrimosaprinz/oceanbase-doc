# Overview

XMLType is a XML data type in SQL. As an abstract data type, XMLType supports XMLType constructors and PL methods for various XML operations.
You can use XMLType as other SQL data types. For example, you can create an XMLType table or view. In a PL stored procedure, you can use XMLType data as parameters, return values, and variables.

You can use an XML Path Language (XPath) expression (or simply an XPath) to query and update XML documents. In addition, OceanBase Database supports various XMLType functions that allow you to efficiently query, update, and search XML documents. For more information about these XML functions, see [XML functions](../../../500.functions-of-oracle-mode/200.single-row-functions-of-oracle-mode/1300.xml-functions-of-oracle-mode/100.xml-functions-overview-of-oracle-mode.md).
