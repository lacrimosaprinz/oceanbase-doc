# Overview

The numeric data types store fixed-point numbers, floating-point numbers, and zeros. OceanBase Database provides four numeric data types: NUMBER, FLOAT, BINARY_FLOAT, and BINARY_DOUBLE. This topic describes numeric data types supported by OceanBase Database.

The priorities of different numeric data types are different. For more information, see [Precedence of numeric data types](../300.numeric-data-type-of-oracle-mode/500.numeric-priority-of-oracle-mode.md).

The following table lists numeric data types supported by OceanBase Database.

| **Data type** | Fixed/Variable length | **Length (bytes)** | **Consideration** |
|---------------|------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| NUMBER(p,s) | Variable | \[4,40\] | The variable-length fixed-point numbers with decimal precision or floating-point numbers. When it is the data type of floating-point numbers, the `NUMBER` data type does not include the `p` and `s` parameters.  |
| FLOAT(p) | Variable | \[4,40\] | A subtype of the `NUMBER` data type. Binary precision range: \[1,126\]. `FLOAT` does not indicate floating-point numbers.  |
| BINARY_FLOAT | Fixed | 4 | The floating-point numbers with binary precision. It is the data type of the floating-point numbers with 32-bit single precision.  |
| BINARY_DOUBLE | Fixed | 8 | The floating-point numbers with binary precision. It is the data type of the floating-point numbers with 64-bit double precision.  |
