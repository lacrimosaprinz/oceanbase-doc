# Overview

Large objects (LOBs) store large unstructured data such as literals, images, videos, and spatial data. LOBs include binary large objects (BLOBs) and character large objects (CLOBs). This topic describes the LOB data types supported by OceanBase Database and the corresponding limitations.

## LOB data types

The following table describes the LOB data types supported by OceanBase Database.

| Type | Fixed/Variable length | Maximum length of definition | Character set |
|------|----|----------------|-----------|
| BLOB | Variable | 536,870,910 bytes | BINARY |
| CLOB | Variable | 536,870,910 bytes | Same as the character set of the tenant. |

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Unlike Oracle Database that references data by using the LOB locator, OceanBase Database stores the LOB locator in the same structure as the data. </p>

## Limitations for using LOB columns

`LOB` columns are subject to the following limitations:

* Do not specify a `LOB` column as a primary key column.

* The following data structures are only temporary instances and cannot be stored in database tables:

   * `VARRAY` of any `LOB` type

   * Any `VARRAY` that contains a `LOB` type, such as an object type with the `LOB` attribute

   * `ANYDATA` of any `LOB` type

   * Any `ANYDATA` that contains a `LOB` type

* Do not specify a `LOB` column in the `ORDER BY` clause or `GROUP BY` clause in a query.

* Do not specify a `LOB` column in a join or a `SELECT...DISTINCT` or `SELECT...UNIQUE` statement.

* When you create a `AFTER UPDATE` DML trigger, do not specify a `LOB` column in an `UPDATE OF` clause.

* Do not specify a `LOB` column as a part of an index key.
