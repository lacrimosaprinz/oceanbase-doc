# BLOB data type

The term BLOB stands for binary large object. This topic describes how to use the BLOB data type.

## Considerations

`BLOBs` are used to store large binary objects in a database. `BLOBs` can be considered as bit streams with no character set semantics. A `BLOB` stores up to 536,870,910 bytes of binary data in the `BINARY` character set.

In databases, large files such as images, videos, and audio files are stored in a `BLOB` field that converts large files into binary format before storage.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>Large binary files may degrade the database performance. </p>
  </main>

`BLOBs` have full transactional support. Changes made by using SQL statements and the DBMS_LOB package participate in the transaction. Therefore, changes to `BLOB` values can be committed and rolled back. However, you cannot save a BLOB locator in a PL variable in one transaction and then use it in another transaction or session.

## Examples

Execute the following statement to create a table named `blob_tbl` and set the data type of the `blob_col` column to `BLOB`.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE blob_tbl (blob_col BLOB);
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
