# CLOB data type

The term CLOB stands for character large object. This topic describes how to use the CLOB data type and provides an example to show you how to create a CLOB column.

## Considerations

`CLOBs` are used to store single-byte and multi-byte character data. `CLOBs` support fixed-width and variable-width character sets. These character sets both use the database character set. A `CLOB` can store up to 536,870,910 bytes of data, and uses the same character set as the tenant.

A field of the `VARCHAR2` data type can store a maximum of 32,767 bytes of data. To store a field with a length greater than 32,767 bytes, you can convert the field to the `CLOB` data type. You can also use `CLOBs` to store `CHAR` data. For example, you can use `CLOBs` to store XML documents.

`CLOBs` have full transactional support. Changes made by using SQL statements and the DBMS_LOB package participate in the transaction. Therefore, changes to `CLOB` values can be committed and rolled back. However, you cannot save a CLOB locator in a PL variable in one transaction and then use it in another transaction or session.

## Examples

Execute the following statement to create a table named `clob_tbl` and set the data type of the `clob_col` column to `CLOB`.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE clob_tbl (clob_col CLOB);
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
