# Any types

OceanBase Database provides SQL-based interfaces to define new types in case the built-in types and types supported by ANSI cannot meet your requirements. You can implement these types in C/C++, Java, or PL. This topic describes the Any types provided by OceanBase Database.

OceanBase Database provides the infrastructure services required for input-output, access to new data types from heterogeneous clients, and optimized data transmission between applications and databases.

You can use these interfaces to create user-defined (or object) types. OceanBase Database also uses these interfaces to create some general data types.

OceanBase Database provides Any types to help you flexibly model process parameters. These data types allow you to dynamically encapsulate and access type descriptions, data instances, and data instance sets of any other SQL type. Any types have a PL interface for data type construction and access.

The current version of OceanBase Database supports the following Any types:

* ANYTYPE

   This type can contain a type description of a named SQL type or an unnamed transient type.

* ANYDATA

   This type contains instances of the specified type, data, and a description of the type. These values can be SQL built-in types or custom types.
