# Data type precedence

OceanBase Database determines the order of implicit data type conversion based on the data type precedence. This topic describes data type precedence for conversion.

OceanBase Database data types take the following precedence (from high to low) during conversion:

1. Datetime and interval data types

2. `BINARY_DOUBLE` data type

3. `BINARY_FLOAT` data type

4. `NUMBER` data type

5. Character data types

6. All other built-in data types
