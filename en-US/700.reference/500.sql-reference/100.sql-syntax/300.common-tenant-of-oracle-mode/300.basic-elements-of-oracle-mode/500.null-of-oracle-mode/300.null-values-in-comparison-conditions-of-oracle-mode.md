# NULLs in comparison conditions

NULLs in comparison conditions are compared with other conditions.

To test for NULLs, you can use only the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators. Because `NULL` means a lack of data, a `NULL` value cannot be equal to, unequal to, greater than, or less than any other value. It cannot be compared with any values, including itself.

OceanBase Database considers two NULLs to be equal when it evaluates a `DECODE` function. Two NULLs are also considered equal if they appear in compound keys. This means that OceanBase Database considers two identical compound keys containing NULLs if all the non-NULL fields of the keys are equal.

The following table lists results of the comparison conditions based on the value of A.

| Condition | Value of A | Result |
|---------------|------|-------|
| A IS NULL | 10 | FALSE |
| A IS NOT NULL | 10 | TRUE |
| A IS NULL | NULL | TRUE |
| A IS NOT NULL | NULL | FALSE |
