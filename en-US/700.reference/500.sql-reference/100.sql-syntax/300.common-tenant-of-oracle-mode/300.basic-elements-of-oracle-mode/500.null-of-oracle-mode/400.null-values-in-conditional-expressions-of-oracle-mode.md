# NULLs in conditional expressions

A NULL in a conditional expression is used for logic judgment. No line is returned as the judgment result, that is UNKNOWN.

A NULL in a conditional expression indicates NULL in the condition `= NULL`, `!= NULL`, `NULL =`, or `NULL ! =`.

To test for NULLs in OceanBase Database, use the comparison operator `IS NULL`. The returned result is `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Based on the judgment result `FALSE`, the judgment result `NOT FALSE` is `TRUE`. However, based on the judgment result `UNKNOWN`, the judgment result `NOT UNKNOWN` remains `UNKNOWN`.

The following table lists results of the conditional expression based on the value of A.

| Condition | Value of A | Result |
|-----------|------|---------|
| A = NULL | 10 | UNKNOWN |
| A != NULL | 10 | UNKNOWN |
| A = NULL | NULL | UNKNOWN |
| A != NULL | NULL | UNKNOWN |
| A = 10 | NULL | UNKNOWN |
| A != 10 | NULL | UNKNOWN |

    <p>If the condition with the judgment result <code>UNKNOWN</code> is used in the <code>WHERE</code> condition of the <code>SELECT</code> statement, no line is returned in the result. </p>
