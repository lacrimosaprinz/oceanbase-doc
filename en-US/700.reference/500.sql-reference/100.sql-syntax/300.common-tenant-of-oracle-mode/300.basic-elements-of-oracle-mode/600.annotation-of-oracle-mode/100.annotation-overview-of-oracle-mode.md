# Overview

OceanBase Database supports the comment feature. This feature improves readability of SQL statements and enriches the features of the SQL statements.

You can create the following comments in OceanBase Database:

* Comments within SQL statements

   These comments are stored as a part of the application code in the executed SQL statements.

* Comments on schema and non-schema objects

   These comments are stored with the metadata of the objects in the data dictionary.

* Hints

   Hints are comments in SQL statements that pass instructions to the OceanBase Database optimizer.
