# Comments within SQL statements

Comments within SQL statements can make your application easier to read and maintain. A comment can be placed between any keywords, parameters, or punctuation marks in a statement.

For example, you can add a comment in a statement to describe the purpose of the statement in your application. Comments, except for hints, within SQL statements have no effect on the execution of the statement.

You can add a comment to a statement in one of the following ways:

* Start the comment with a slash and an asterisk (/\*).

   Add the comment text after the slash and the asterisk. The text can span multiple lines and must end with an asterisk and a slash (\*/). Spaces or line breakers are not required between the comment content and opening or closing characters.

* Start the comment with two hyphens (--).

   Add the comment text after the two hyphens and a space. The text cannot extend to a new line and must end with a line break.

An SQL statement can contain multiple comments in both styles. The comment text can contain any printable character in the database character set.

The following example shows a comment that starts with a slash and an asterisk (/\*).

```sql
SELECT last_name, emp_id, salary + NVL(comm_pct, 0),
            job_id, e.dept_id
  /* Select employees whose salary is higher than that of Zhangsan.*/
  FROM emp e, dept d
  /* The dept table stores department names.*/
  WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id
    AND salary + NVL(comm_pct,0) >   /* Subquery:       */
       (SELECT salary + NVL(comm_pct,0)
         FROM emp
         WHERE last_name = 'Zhangsan')
  ORDER BY last_name, emp_id;
```



The following example shows a comment that starts with two hyphens (--).

```sql
SELECT last_name,                                   -- Select the employee name,
       employee_id                                  -- employee ID,
       salary + NVL(commission_pct, 0),             -- total salary,
       job_id,                                      -- job title,
       e.department_id                              -- department
  FROM employees e,                                 -- from the employees table.
       departments d
  WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
    AND salary + NVL(commission_pct, 0) >          

        (SELECT salary + NVL(commission_pct,0)      
          FROM employees
          WHERE last_name = 'Zhangsan')            
  ORDER BY last_name                                
           employee_id                              
;
```
