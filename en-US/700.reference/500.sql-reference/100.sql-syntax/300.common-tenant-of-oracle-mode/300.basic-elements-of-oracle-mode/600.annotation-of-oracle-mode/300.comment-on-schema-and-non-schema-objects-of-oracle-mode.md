# Comments on schema and non-schema objects

You can use the COMMENT statement to associate a comment with a schema object (table, view, materialized view, operator, index type) or a non-schema object (edition) in OceanBase Database. Comments associated with schema and non-schema objects are stored in the data dictionary.

The syntax for creating comments on schema and non-schema objects is as follows:

```sql
COMMENT ON {TABLE table | COLUMN column | INDEXTYPE indextype
| OPERATOR operator | VIEW view} IS string
```

Here are some examples:

* Add a comment on a user table

   ```sql
   COMMENT ON TABLE test.user is "This table stores user information";
   ```

* Add a comment on the `user_name` column

   ```sql
   COMMENT ON COLUMN test.user.user_name is "This column stores the username";
   ```
