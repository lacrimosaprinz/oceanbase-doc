# Schema objects

A schema is a logic structure of data and a set of schema objects. Schema objects refer to database objects in the schema.

OceanBase Database uses a schema to refer to a set of database objects belonging to a user and perform privilege management and namespace isolation based on the schema. A schema corresponds to an application. When a user is created, it has a default schema. The schema name is the same as the username.

A user can access and use schemas of other users. When you access an object without specifying a schema, the system automatically adds the default schema name of the object.

A schema can contain the following objects:

* Tables

* Views

* Indexes

* Partitions

* Sequences

* Synonyms

* Triggers

* PL objects, such as PL subprograms, packages, and triggers
