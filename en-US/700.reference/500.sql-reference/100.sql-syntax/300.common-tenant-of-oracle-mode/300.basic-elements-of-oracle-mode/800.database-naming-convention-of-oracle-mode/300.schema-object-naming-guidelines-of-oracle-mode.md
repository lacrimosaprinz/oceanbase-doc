# Suggestions on schema object names

This topic describes suggestions on schema object names.

Suggestions on schema object names in OceanBase Database are as follows:

* Use complete, descriptive and spellable names or well-known abbreviations.

* Use the same naming rules.

* Use the same name to describe an entity or attribute that crosses tables.

If you cannot ensure simplicity and descriptiveness at the same time when you name an object, prefer descriptive words to name the object. This is because objects in a database may be used for a long period. Using a descriptive name allows future users to understand the object based on the name. For example, users cannot understand which type of information a `pmdd` table stores, but a `payment_due_date` table allows users to understand the information stored in the table based on the name.

Using the same naming rules can help you understand the role of each table in an application. For example, start with `fin_` to name tables that belong to the `FINANCE` applications.

Use the same name to describe the same content in a table. For example, an employee table and a department table have the same department ID. The column of the department ID stores the same values. In this case, you can name this column as `department_id` in the employee table and department table.
