# Create a DBLink

To reference an object in another database, you must add, after the object name, the name of the DBLink that points to this database. A DBLink is a schema object that enables OceanBase Database to connect to a remote database to access the objects in the remote database.

You can use the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` statement to create a DBLink. You must specify the following information when you use this statement:

* Tenant name, username, and password

* URL and port number

OceanBase Database stores the preceding information in the data dictionary.

Limitations on creating a DBLink are as follows:

* You can create only a DBLink that connects two Oracle tenants of OceanBase Database. In OceanBase Database, you cannot create a DBLink that points to an Oracle database.

* You can create and delete DBLinks for a tenant. A tenant can have at most 15 DBLinks.
