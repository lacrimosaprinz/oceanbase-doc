# Reference a DBLink

When you issue an SQL statement that contains a DBLink, you must use the complete DBLink name stored in the data dictionary.

OceanBase Database uses a connection string to access a remote database. If OceanBase Database successfully connects to the remote database by using the connection string, username, and password, it uses the rules in the referenced schema object to access specified objects in the remote database. To access a table object in another schema, you must explicitly specify the database name, such as `test.t1@my_link`.
