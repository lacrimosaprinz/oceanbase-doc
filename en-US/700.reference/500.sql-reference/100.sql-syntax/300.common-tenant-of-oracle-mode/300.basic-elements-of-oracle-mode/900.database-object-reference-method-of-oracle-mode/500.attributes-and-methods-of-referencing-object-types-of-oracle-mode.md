# Reference an attribute or method of an object type

To reference an attribute or method of an object type in an SQL statement, use a table alias to fully qualify the reference.

Schema `ob` in the following example contains the `cust_addr_typ` type and the `customers` table. The `customers` table has a `cust_address` column of the `cust_addr_typ` type.

```sql
CREATE TYPE cust_addr_typ
AS OBJECT
    (street_address    VARCHAR2(40),
     postal_code       VARCHAR2(10),
     city              VARCHAR2(30),
     state_province    VARCHAR2(10),
     country_id        CHAR(2));
/
CREATE TABLE customers
  (customer_id        NUMBER(6),
   cust_first_name    VARCHAR2(20) CONSTRAINT cust_fname_nn NOT NULL,
   cust_last_name     VARCHAR2(20) CONSTRAINT cust_lname_nn NOT NULL,
   cust_address       cust_addr_typ,
. . .)
```

In an SQL statement, the reference to the `postal_code` attribute must be fully qualified with the table alias, as shown in the following example:

```sql
SELECT c.cust_address.postal_code
FROM customers c;

UPDATE customers c
SET c.cust_address.postal_code = '610000'
WHERE c.cust_address.city = 'chengdu'
AND c.cust_address.state_province = 'SICHUAN';
```

To reference a member method that does not accept parameters, you must provide empty parentheses. For example, assume that the sample schema `ob` contains an object table `category_tab` based on `catalog_typ`. This table contains the member function `getCatalogName`. To call this method in an SQL statement, you must provide empty parentheses, as shown in the following example:

```sql
SELECT TREAT(VALUE(c) AS catalog_typ).getCatalogName() "Catalog Type"
FROM categories_tab c
WHERE category_id = 10;
```

The returned result is as follows:

```sql
+----------------+
| Catalog Type   |
+----------------+
| online catalog |
+----------------+
```
