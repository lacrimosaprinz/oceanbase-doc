# Overview

An operator joins individual data items such as operands or parameters and returns a result. Syntactically, an operator can appear before an operand, after an operand, or between two operands.

Operators are represented by special characters or keywords. For example, the division operator is represented by a forward slash (/).

General operators can be categorized into unary and binary operators.

* Unary operators

   A unary operator operates on only one operand. A unary operator typically appears in the following format:

   ```sql
   operator operand
   ```

* Binary operators

   As the name suggests, a binary operator operates on two operands. A binary operator typically appears in the following format:

   ```sql
   operand1 operator operand2
   ```

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Other operators with special formats can accept more than two operands. </li>
    <li>If an operator is given a NULL operand, the result is always NULL. The only operator that does not follow this rule is the concatenation operator (||) </li>

This chapter describes non-logical (non-Boolean) operators that cannot be used alone as the `WHERE` or `HAVING` condition in queries or subqueries. OceanBase Database supports the following operators:

* [Arithmetic operators](../400.operator-of-oracle-mode/300.arithmetic-operators-of-oracle-mode.md)

* [Concatenation operator](../400.operator-of-oracle-mode/400.concatenate-operators-of-oracle-mode.md)

* [Hierarchical query operators](../400.operator-of-oracle-mode/500.hierarchical-query-operators-of-oracle-mode.md)

* [Set operators](../400.operator-of-oracle-mode/600.set-operators-of-oracle-mode.md)

* [COLLATE operator](../400.operator-of-oracle-mode/700.collation-of-oracle-mode.md)
