# Concatenation operator

The concatenation operator (\|\|) concatenates strings and CLOB data. A new string is obtained after you concatenate two strings by using the concatenation operator.

If both strings are of the `CHAR` data type, the result is also of the `CHAR` data type and cannot exceed 2,000 characters in length.

If either string is of the `VARCHAR2` data type, the result is also of the `VARCHAR2` data type and cannot exceed 4,000 characters in length.

If either parameter to the concatenation operator is of the `CLOB` data type, the return type is temporary `CLOB`.

Although OceanBase Database treats a zero-length string as a NULL, concatenating an operand with another zero-length string results in an operand. Therefore, `NULL` can result only from the concatenation of two `NULL` strings. To concatenate an expression that might be NULL, you can use the NVL() function to explicitly convert the expression to a zero-length string.

The following example creates a table that contains `CHAR` and `VARCHAR2` columns, inserts values with and without trailing spaces to the columns, and concatenates two of the values.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (col1 VARCHAR2(6), col2 CHAR(10), col3 VARCHAR2(10), col4 CHAR(6));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO tbl1 (col1, col2, col3, col4) VALUES ('abc', 'def ', 'ghi ', 'jkl');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT col1 || col2 || col3 || col4 "Concatenation" FROM tbl1;
+----------------------------+
| Concatenation              |
+----------------------------+
| abcdef       ghi    jkl    |
+----------------------------+
1 row in set
```
