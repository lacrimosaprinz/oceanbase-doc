# Set operators

Set operators combine the results of two queries into a single result. Queries that contain set operators are called compound queries.

The following table lists the set operators that are supported by the current version of OceanBase Database.

| Operator | Return value |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| UNION | Returns all distinct rows selected by either query.  |
| UNION ALL | Returns all rows selected by either query, including all duplicate rows.  |
| INTERSECT | Returns all distinct rows selected by both queries.  |
| MINUS | Returns distinct rows selected by the first query but not the second.  |

For more information and examples about set operators, see [Compound query](../800.queries-and-subqueries-of-oracle-mode/400.collection-of-oracle-mode.md).
