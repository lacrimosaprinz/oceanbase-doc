# UNIFORM

## Syntax

```sql
UNIFORM(<min> , <max> , <gen>)
```

## Purpose

`UNIFORM()` returns a uniformly distributed integer or floating-point number. 

* `min` and `max` must be scalar values that do not change with row iteration. For example, they can be constants and scalar functions. In PL, they can also be `@v1` and `1+@v3`. 
* In Oracle mode, `min` and `max` are treated as the `NUMBER` type, regardless of whether they are integers. The output of the `UNIFORM()` function is a floating-point number. To generate an integer, you can use `UNIFORM()` together with the `FLOOR()` function. 
* `gen` is a numeric value generation function. Generally, the `RANDOM()` function is used. If the input value is a constant, `UNIFORM()` returns a fixed value. 

## Examples

The following example shows that the data type of the result returned by `UNIFORM()` is related with the type of its arguments. 

```shell
obclient> SELECT UNIFORM(0.0, 10, RANDOM()) FROM TABLE(GENERATOR(4)) ORDER BY 1;
+--------------------------+
| UNIFORM(0.0,10,RANDOM()) |
+--------------------------+
|        .8657087411722835 |
|       1.0922542185892958 |
|       1.1803956370514672 |
|        5.613282729140028 |
+--------------------------+
