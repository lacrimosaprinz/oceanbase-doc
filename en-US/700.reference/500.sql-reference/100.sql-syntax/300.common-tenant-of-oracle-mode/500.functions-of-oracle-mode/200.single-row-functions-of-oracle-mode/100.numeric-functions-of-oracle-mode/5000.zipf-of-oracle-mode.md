# ZIPF

## Syntax

```sql
ZIPF(<s> , <N> , <gen>)
```

## Purpose

`ZIPF()` returns a Zipf-distributed integer in the value range of [0, N) and with the distribution exponent of `s`. 

* The larger the `s`, the more skewed the generated sequence, and the steeper the curve of the sequence. 
* `s` and `N` must be scalar values that do not change with row iteration. For example, they can be integral or floating-point constants and scalar functions. In PL, they can also be `@v1` and `1+@v3`. The value range of `s` is [1, + âˆž). The value range of `N` is [1, 16777215]. 
* The amount of storage and computing resources consumed by the Zipf algorithm is related to the value of `N`. The space complexity of the algorithm is `O(N)`. The time complexity is `O(logN)` for the generation of each integer. Therefore, the value range of `N` is limited to [1, 16777215]. 
* `gen` is a numeric value generation function. Generally, the `RANDOM()` function is used. If the input value is a constant, `ZIPF()` returns a fixed value. 

## Examples

The following example shows how to use the `ZIPF()` function to return a Zipf-distributed integer. 

```shell
obclient> SELECT ZIPF(1, 10, RANDOM()) FROM TABLE(GENERATOR(6));
+-----------------------+
|  ZIPF(1,10,RANDOM())  |
+-----------------------+
|                     2 |
|                     0 |
|                     0 |
|                     0 |
|                     3 |
|                     3 |
+-----------------------+
6 rows in set

obclient> SELECT ZIPF(1, 10, 0415) FROM TABLE(GENERATOR(6));
+-------------------+
| ZIPF(1, 10, 0415) |
+-------------------+
|                 1 |
|                 1 |
|                 1 |
|                 1 |
|                 1 |
|                 1 |
+-------------------+
6 rows in set

obclient> SELECT ZIPF(ABS(-1), 23, RANDOM()) FROM DUAL;
+-----------------------------+
| ZIPF(ABS(-1),23,RANDOM()) |
+-----------------------------+
|                           9 |
+-----------------------------+
1 row in set
```
