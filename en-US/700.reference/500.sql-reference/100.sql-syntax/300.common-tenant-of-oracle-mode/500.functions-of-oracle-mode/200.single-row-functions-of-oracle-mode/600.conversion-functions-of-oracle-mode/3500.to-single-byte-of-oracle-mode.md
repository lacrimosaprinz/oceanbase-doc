# TO_SINGLE_BYTE

## Purpose

`TO_SINGLE_BYTE()` converts all multi-byte characters into the corresponding single-byte characters. This function is valid only when your database character set contains both single-byte and multi-byte characters.

## Syntax

```sql
TO_SINGLE_BYTE(char)
```

## Parameters

`char` can be `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, or `NVARCHAR2`. If a multi-byte character in `char` does not have a single-byte equivalent, the multi-byte character is displayed in the output character string.

## Return type

The return type is the same as the data type of `char`.

## Examples

* The following example converts the multi-byte B in UTF8 to the corresponding single-byte B in ASCII.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT TO_SINGLE_BYTE(CHR(15711394)) FROM DUAL;
   +-------------------------------+
   | TO_SINGLE_BYTE(CHR(15711394)) |
   +-------------------------------+
   | B                             |
   +-------------------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* The following example converts a full-width character in a string into a half-width character.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT TO_SINGLE_BYTE('Ｈｅｌｌｏ  Ｗｏｒｌｄ') AS text FROM DUAL;
   +--------------+
   | TEXT         |
   +--------------+
   | Hello World  |
   +--------------+
   1 row in set
   ```
