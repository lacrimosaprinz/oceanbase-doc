# Compound expressions

A compound expression is an expression composed of multiple types of expressions.

The syntax of a compound expression is as follows:

```sql
{ (expr)
| { + | - | PRIOR } expr
| expr { * | / | + | - | || } expr
}
```

Where, the `PRIOR` operator is used for the `CONNECT BY` clause in a hierarchical query.

You can use any built-in function as an expression. However, inappropriate combinations of functions in compound expressions will be deprecated. For example, the `LENGTH()` function is inappropriate for aggregate functions.

The following examples are some valid compound expressions:

* `('WELL' || 'SMITH')`

* `LENGTH('OCEAN1BASE') * 17`

* `SORT(221) + 32`

* `my_func(TO_CHAR(sysdate, 'DD-MMM-YY'))`
