# CURSOR expressions

A CURSOR expression returns a nested cursor. An expression in this form is equivalent to the PL REF CURSOR and can be passed to a function as a REF CURSOR argument.

## Syntax

```sql
CURSOR (subquery)
```

When the `CURSOR` expression is evaluated, a nested cursor is implicitly opened. For example, if a CURSOR expression appears in the select list, a nested cursor is opened each time the query fetches a row.

A nested cursor is closed only in the following cases:

* The nested cursor is explicitly closed by the user.

* The parent cursor is re-executed.

* The parent cursor is closed.

* The parent cursor is canceled.

* An error occurred during the fetch on one of its parent cursors. In this case, the nested cursor is closed as part of the clean-up.

## Limitations

A CURSOR expression has the following limitations:

* If the enclosing statement is not a `SELECT` statement, the nested cursor can only be used as a procedural `REF CURSOR` argument.

* If the enclosing statement is a `SELECT` statement, the nested cursor can also appear in the outermost select list of the query specification or the outermost select list of another nested cursor.

* Nested cursors cannot appear in views.

* You cannot perform `BIND` and `EXECUTE` operations on nested cursors.

## Examples

* Use the `CURSOR` expression in the select list of a query.

* Use the `CURSOR` expression as a function argument. Delete all employees of a department from the `emp` table, and delete departments with no employees from the `dept` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> DECLARE
            v_dept_id emp.deptno%TYPE := 10;
        BEGIN
            DELETE FROM emp WHERE deptno=v_dept_id;
            IF SQL%NOTFOUND THEN
                DELETE FROM dept WHERE deptno=v_dept_id;
            END IF;
   END;
   /
