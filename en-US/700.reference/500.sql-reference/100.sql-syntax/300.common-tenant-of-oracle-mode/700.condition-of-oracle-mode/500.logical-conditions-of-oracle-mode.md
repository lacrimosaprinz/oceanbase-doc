# Logical conditions

A logical condition combines two conditions to generate a single result or reverse the result of a single condition.

Logical conditions are `NOT`, `AND`, and `OR`.

## NOT

The logical condition `NOT` can reverse the result of a single condition.

### Judgment rules

If the result of the condition is `FALSE`, `TRUE` is returned. If the result of the condition is `TRUE`, `FALSE` is returned. If the result of the condition is `UNKNOWN`, `UNKNOWN` is returned.

### Sample NOT condition

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE NOT (job_id IS NULL) ORDER BY empno;
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE NOT (salary BETWEEN 11000 AND 22000) ORDER BY empno;
```

## AND

The logical condition `AND` combines two conditions.

### Judgment rules

If the results of both conditions are `TRUE`, `TRUE` is returned. If the result of either condition is `FALSE`, `FALSE` is returned. If the result of one condition is `UNKNOWN` and that of the other is `FALSE`, `FALSE` is returned. Otherwise, `UNKNOWN` is returned.

### Sample AND condition

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job_id = 'PU_CLERK' AND dept_id = 32 ORDER BY empno;
```

## OR

The logical condition `OR` evaluates whether either condition is true.

### Judgment rules

If the result of either condition is `TRUE`, `TRUE` is returned. If the results of both conditions are `FALSE`, `FALSE` is returned. Otherwise, `UNKNOWN` is returned.

### Sample OR condition

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job_id = 'PU_CLERK' OR dept_id = 10 ORDER BY empno;
```
