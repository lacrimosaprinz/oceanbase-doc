# Compound conditions

A compound condition is a group of multiple other conditions.

The syntax of compound conditions is as follows:

```sql
{ (condition) | NOT condition | condition { AND | OR } condition }
```

For more information about the `NOT`, `AND`, and `OR` conditions, see [Logical conditions](../700.condition-of-oracle-mode/500.logical-conditions-of-oracle-mode.md).
