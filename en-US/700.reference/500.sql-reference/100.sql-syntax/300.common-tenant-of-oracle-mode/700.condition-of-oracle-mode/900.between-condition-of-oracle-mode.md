# BETWEEN condition

The BETWEEN condition is used to determine whether the value of an expression falls within an interval defined by another two expressions.

## Syntax

The syntax of the BETWEEN condition is follows:

```sql
expr1 [ NOT ] BETWEEN expr2 AND expr3
```

`expr1 NOT BETWEEN expr2 AND expr3` is equivalent to `NOT (expr1 BETWEEN expr2 AND expr3)`, and `expr1 BETWEEN expr2 AND expr3` is equivalent to `expr2 <= expr1 AND expr1 <= expr3`.

`expr1`, `expr2`, and `expr3` must all be numeric, character, or datetime expressions. If `expr3 < expr2`, the interval is empty. If `NULL` is specified for `expr1`, the result is `NULL`. If `expr1` is not NULL, this value is generally FALSE, and is `TRUE` when the `NOT` keyword is specified.

In SQL, `expr1` may be evaluated more than once. If an expression appears in PL, `expr1` is calculated only once.

If the expressions are not all of the same data type, OceanBase Database implicitly converts the expressions to the same data type. If the expressions cannot be converted to the same data type, an error is returned.

## Examples

Query employees whose salary ranges from 2,100 to 3,500 and sort them by employee ID.

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE salary BETWEEN 2100 AND 3500 ORDER BY empno;
```
