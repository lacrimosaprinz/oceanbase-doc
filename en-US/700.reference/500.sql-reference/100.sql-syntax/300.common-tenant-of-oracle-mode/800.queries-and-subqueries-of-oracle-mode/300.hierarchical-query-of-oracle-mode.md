# Hierarchical query

A hierarchical query is a special query that can present hierarchical data in a hierarchical order.

Hierarchical data refers to data with a hierarchical relationship in relational tables. This type of relationship is very common in our daily life. Here are some examples:

* The relationship between team leaders and team members

* The relationship between upper-level and lower-level departments in enterprises

* The relationship between source and destination web pages in page jumping scenarios

## Syntax

The syntax of `SELECT` for a simple query is as follows:

```sql
SELECT [level], column, expr... FROM table [WHERE condition] [ START WITH start_expression ]
CONNECT BY [NOCYCLE] { PRIOR child_expr = parent_expr | parent_expr = PRIOR child_expr }
[ ORDER SIBLINGS BY ...] [ GROUP BY ... ] [ HAVING ... ] [ ORDER BY ... ]
```

The following table describes the parameters in the syntax.

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| level | The level, namely, the hierarchy of the node. It is a pseudocolumn. Counting from the start point of a query, the level starts from 1, and so forth.  |
| CONNECT_BY_ISLEAF | Indicates whether the current row is a leaf node. It is a pseudocolumn. Valid values:  <ul><li>0: indicates that the current row is not a leaf node.</li>  <li>1: indicates that the current row is a leaf node.</li></ul>  |
| CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE | Indicates whether the current row is in a cycle. It is a pseudocolumn. Valid values:  <ul><li>0: indicates that the current row is not in a cycle.</li>  <li>1: indicates that the current row is in a cycle.</li></ul>  |
| CONNECT_BY_ROOT | `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` is a unary operator, indicating that the column in the parameter comes from the root node of the hierarchical query. It has the same precedence as the unary operators + and -.  |
| condition | The condition.  |
| CONNECT BY | Indicates how to determine the parent-child relationship. An equality expression is usually used. Other expressions are also supported.  |
| START WITH | The root row in the hierarchical query.  |
| PRIOR | `PRIOR` is a unary operator, indicating that the column in the parameter comes from the parent row. It has the same precedence as the unary operators + and -.  |
| NOCYCLE | If this keyword is specified, the result can still be returned even if it contains a cycle. The `CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE` pseudocolumn can be used to specify where the cycle occurs. Otherwise, an error is returned.  |
| ORDER SIBLINGS BY | The sorting order for rows of siblings of the same parent.  |

## Execution process

Before you take use of a hierarchical query, you must understand its execution process. The following describes the general execution process of a hierarchical query:

1. Execute the `SCAN` or `JOIN` operation after the `FROM` clause.

2. Generate a hierarchical relationship based on `START WITH` and `CONNECT BY`.

   The procedure for generating a hierarchical relationship is as follows:
   1. Obtain the root rows based on the expression in `START WITH`.

   2. Select the child rows of each root row based on the expression in `CONNECT BY`.

3. Use the child rows generated in Step 2 as the new root rows and generate child rows for them. Repeat these steps cyclically until no new rows are generated.

4. Execute the rest clauses such as `WHERE`, `GROUP`, and `ORDER BY` based on the general query execution process.

## Examples

Create a table named `emp` and insert data into the `emp_id`, `position`, and `mgr_id` columns of the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE emp(emp_id INT,position VARCHAR(50),mgr_id INT);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (1,'Global manager',NULL);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (2,'Manager of European region',1);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (3,'Manager of Asia-Pacific region',1);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (4,'Manager of Americas region',1);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (5,'Manager of Italy region',2);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (6,'Manager of France region',2);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (7,'Manager of China region',3);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (8,'Manager of South Korea region',3);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (9,'Manager of Japan region',3);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (10,'Manager of US region',4);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (11,'Manager of Canada region',4);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (12,'Manager of Beijing,China region',7);
```

In the preceding table, the `position` column has a clear hierarchical relationship.

Execute the following statement to present the results in a hierarchical structure:

```sql
obclient> SELECT emp_id, mgr_id, position, level FROM emp
    START WITH mgr_id IS NULL CONNECT BY PRIOR emp_id = mgr_id;
+--------+--------+----------------------------------+-------+
| EMP_ID | MGR_ID | POSITION                         | LEVEL |
+--------+--------+----------------------------------+-------+
|      1 |   NULL | Global manager                   |     1 |
|      2 |      1 | Manager of Europe region         |     2 |
|      5 |      2 | Manager of Italy region          |     3 |
|      6 |      2 | Manager of France region         |     3 |
|      3 |      1 | Manager of Asia-Pacific region   |     2 |
|      7 |      3 | Manager of China region          |     3 |
|     12 |      7 | Manager of Beijing, China region |     4 |
|      8 |      3 | Manager of South Korea region    |     3 |
|      9 |      3 | Manager of Japan region          |     3 |
|      4 |      1 | Manager of Americas region       |     2 |
|     10 |      4 | Manager of US region             |     3 |
|     11 |      4 | Manager of Canada region         |     3 |
+--------+--------+----------------------------------+-------+
12 rows in set
```

Execute the following statement to query the hierarchical structure of the Asia-Pacific region:

```sql
obclient> SELECT emp_id, mgr_id, position, level FROM emp
    START WITH position = 'Manager of Asia-Pacific region' CONNECT BY PRIOR emp_id = mgr_id;
+--------+--------+----------------------------------+-------+
| EMP_ID | MGR_ID | POSITION                         | LEVEL |
+--------+--------+----------------------------------+-------+
|      3 |      1 | Manager of Asia-Pacific region   |     1 |
|      7 |      3 | Manager of China region          |     2 |
|     12 |      7 | Manager of Beijing, China region |     3 |
|      8 |      3 | Manager of South Korea region    |     2 |
|      9 |      3 | Manager of Japan region          |     2 |
+--------+--------+----------------------------------+-------+
5 rows in set
```
