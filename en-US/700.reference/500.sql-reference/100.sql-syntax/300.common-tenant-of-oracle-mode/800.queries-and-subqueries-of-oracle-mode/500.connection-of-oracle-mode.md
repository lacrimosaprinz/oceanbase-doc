# Join query

A join query is a query that combines rows from two or more tables, views, or materialized views. When the FROM clause in a query specifies multiple tables, OceanBase Database performs a join query and selects a column from any table specified in the FROM clause as the output column. If two or more tables have an identical column name, you must define all references to this column in the query by using the table names.

## Join types

Joins in OceanBase Database include inner joins, outer joins, and semi/anti-joins, among which semi-joins and anti-joins are implemented by rewriting subqueries. OceanBase Database does not provide syntaxes for semi-joins or anti-joins.

## Join conditions

A join condition is a rule that joins multiple tables. Most joins contain at least one join condition in the `FROM` or `WHERE` clause to compare two columns from different tables. The `WHERE` clause may contain other conditions in addition to join conditions. The conditions that reference only one table can further restrict the number of rows returned by a join query.

Join conditions can be divided into equi-join conditions (such as `t1.a = t2.b`) and non-equi-join conditions (such as `t1.a < t2.b`). Unlike non-equi-join conditions, equi-join conditions allow the database to use efficient join algorithms such as `MERGE JOIN` (MJ) and `HASH JOIN` (HJ).

OceanBase Database extracts and pairs rows from different tables and matches them by using join conditions. To join more than two tables, OceanBase Database first joins two of them based on their column join conditions, and then joins the results to a new table based on the join conditions between columns of the joined table and the new table. The optimizer determines the join order based on the join conditions, base table indexes, and available statistics.

## Join methods

The following table lists the join methods supported by the current version of OceanBase Database.

| Join type | Form of expression | Description |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Equi-join | Equijoin | A join with a join condition containing an equality operator.  |
| Self-join | SELF JOIN | A join of a table to itself.  |
| Inner join | INNER JOIN | A join of two tables that returns only those rows that satisfy the join condition.  |
| Left (outer) join | LEFT \[OUTER\] JOIN | A join that returns all rows in the table on the left side (to the leftmost of the `JOIN` clause), excluding the unmatching rows in the table on the right side.  |
| Right (outer) join | RIGHT \[OUTER\] JOIN | A join that returns all rows in the table on the right side (to the rightmost of the `JOIN` clause), excluding the unmatched rows in the table on the left side.  |
| Full (outer) join | FULL \[OUTER\] JOIN | A join that returns all rows in all joined tables, regardless of whether the rows are matching.  |
| Semi-join | SEMI JOIN | A join that can be obtained only by expanding and rewriting a subquery.  |
| Anti-join | ANTI JOIN | A join that can be obtained only by expanding and rewriting a subquery.  |
| Cartesian product | Cartesian Product | A query on two tables that are not joined returns the Cartesian product of the two tables.  |

### Equi-join

An equi-join is a join that contains an equality operator. An equi-join combines rows of specific columns that meet the equivalent conditions and outputs them.

### Self-join

A self-join is a join of a table to itself. The table is specified in the `FROM` clause twice, followed by a table alias that qualifies the column names in the join condition. When executing a self-join, OceanBase Database combines and returns the rows that meet the join condition.

### Cartesian product

If a join query does not have a join condition for two tables to be joined, OceanBase Database returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, which is a result set where each row in the first table is paired with each row in the second table. The Cartesian product contains many rows, most of which are useless. For example, the Cartesian product of two 100-row tables contains 10,000 rows. Therefore, we recommend that your query contain at least one join condition to avoid returning the Cartesian product, unless otherwise needed.

If a query joins three or more tables but no join condition is specified, the optimizer can select a join order to avoid generating Cartesian products.

### Inner join

An inner join is the most basic join operation in a database.

An inner join combines the columns of two tables (such as tables A and B) based on the join conditions to generate a new result table. The query compares each row of Table A with each row of Table B and returns the combinations that meet the join conditions. When the join conditions are met, a row in Table A that matches a row in Table B are paired by column (aligned) into one row in the result set. The join first generates the Cartesian product of the two tables, where each row in Table A is paired with each row in Table B, and then returns records that meet the join conditions.

### Outer join

An outer join returns all the rows that meet the join conditions. In addition, it returns unused rows of one table and fills `NULL` in the corresponding positions in the other table.

Outer joins can be further divided into left (outer) joins, right (outer) joins, and full (outer) joins based on whether the rows in the table on the left side, right side, or tables on both sides are retained. In a left (outer) join, if a row in the table on the left side does not have a matching row in the table on the right side, the table on the right side is automatically filled with `NULL`. In a right (outer) join, if a row in the table on the right side does not have a matching row in the table on the left side, the table on the left side is automatically filled with `NULL`. In a full (outer) join, if a row in either table does not have a matching the row in the other table, the latter is automatically filled with `NULL`.

OceanBase Database also supports the outer join sign (+). For a left join, the outer join sign (+) is applied for all columns in the right-side table in the join condition of the `WHERE` clause. For a right join, the outer join sign (+) is applied for all columns in the left-side table in the join condition of the `WHERE` clause. Take note of the following rules and constraints when you use the outer join sign (+):

* If a query block contains the `JOIN` syntax in the `FROM` clause, the outer join sign (+) cannot be specified.

* The outer join sign (+) can appear only in the `WHERE` clause or in the context of left-correlation (when `TABLE` clause is specified) in the `FROM` clause, and can apply only to one column of a table or view.

* If the left-side and right-side tables are joined by using multiple join conditions, the outer join sign (+) must be used in all conditions. Otherwise, the database returns only the row data generated by simple joins and does not report warnings or errors.

* You cannot use the outer join sign (+) to join a table to itself.

* The outer join sign (+) can be applied only to columns rather than expressions.

* The `WHERE` condition containing an outer join sign (+) cannot be used together with a condition that uses the `OR` or `IN` logical operator.

* In a query that executes an outer join for more than two pairs of tables, a table can be only an empty table generated for another table. Therefore, in the join conditions of A and B and those of B and C, the outer join sign (+) cannot be applied to columns of B. In other words, the outer join operator (+) cannot be applied to common columns in multiple join conditions.

### Semi-join

A `left semi-join` or `right semi-join` for Table A and Table B returns only rows in Table A that match rows in Table B and rows in Table B that match rows in Table A. You can get a `semi-join` query only by expanding and rewriting a subquery.

### Anti-join

A `left anti-join` or `right anti-join` for Table A and Table B returns only rows in Table A that do not match rows in Table B and rows in Table B that do not match rows in Table A. Similar to a `semi-join`, you can get an `anti-join` query only by expanding and rewriting a subquery.

## Examples

Create tables named `table_a` and `table_b` and insert data into them.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_a(PK INT, name VARCHAR(25));
INSERT INTO table_a VALUES(1,'Fox');
INSERT INTO table_a VALUES(2,'Police');  
INSERT INTO table_a VALUES(3,'Taxi');  
INSERT INTO table_a VALUES(4,'Lincoln');  
INSERT INTO table_a VALUES(5,'Arizona');  
INSERT INTO table_a VALUES(6,'Washington');  
INSERT INTO table_a VALUES(7,'Dell');  
INSERT INTO table_a VALUES(10,'Lucent');
CREATE TABLE table_b(PK INT, name VARCHAR(25));
INSERT INTO table_b VALUES(1,'Fox');
INSERT INTO table_b VALUES(2,'Police');  
INSERT INTO table_b VALUES(3,'Taxi');  
INSERT INTO table_b VALUES(6,'Washington');  
INSERT INTO table_b VALUES(7,'Dell');  
INSERT INTO table_b VALUES(8,'Microsoft');  
INSERT INTO table_b VALUES(9,'Apple');
INSERT INTO table_b VALUES(11,'Scotch whisky');
```
