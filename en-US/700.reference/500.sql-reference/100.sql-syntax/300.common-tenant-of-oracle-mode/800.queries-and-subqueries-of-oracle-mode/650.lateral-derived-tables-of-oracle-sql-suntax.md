# Lateral derived tables

A lateral derived table is a special type of derived table. You can use the `LATERAL` keyword to specify a derived table that can reference columns of preceding tables or derived tables defined in the same `FROM` clause. This way, subqueries in a derived table can depend on tables defined in the same `FROM` clause and therefore access the column values of those tables. 

The main feature of lateral derived tables is that they can reference columns in tables that are defined previously in the `FROM` clause, while ordinary derived tables cannot. 

## Examples

```sql
SELECT *
FROM A, LATERAL (SELECT * FROM B WHERE B.col1 = A.col1) AS derived_table;
```
