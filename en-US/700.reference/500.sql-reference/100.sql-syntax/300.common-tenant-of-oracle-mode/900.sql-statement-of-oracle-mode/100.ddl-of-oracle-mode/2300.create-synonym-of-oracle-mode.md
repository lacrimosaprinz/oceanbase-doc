# CREATE SYNONYM

## Purpose

You can use this statement to create a synonym.

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] [ PUBLIC ] SYNONYM [ synonym_schema. ]synonym_name
FOR [ object_schema. ]object_name;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OR REPLACE | Specifies to use a new definition to recreate the view if the name of the view to be created already exists.  |
| PUBLIC | Specifies to create a public synonym, which can be used by all users. Only users with the corresponding privileges on the underlying object can use this synonym. A public synonym is used in parsing the reference to an object only when no schema is specified for the object. If `PUBLIC` is not specified, the synonym is private and accessible only within its schema. The name of a private synonym must be unique in its schema.  |
| synonym_schema | The schema where the synonym is located. If `schema.` is omitted, the synonym is in your own schema by default. If `PUBLIC` is specified, `schema` cannot be specified for the synonym.  |
| synonym_name | The name of the synonym.  |
| object_schema | The schema that contains the object for which the synonym is created. If `schema.` is omitted, the object for which the synonym is created is in your own schema by default.  |
| object_name | The name of the object for which the synonym is created.  |

## Examples

* Create a synonym for a table.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl1(col1 INT,col2 INT);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> CREATE SYNONYM syn1 FOR tbl1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> INSERT INTO syn1 VALUES(1,1);
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM syn1;
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    1 |    1 |
   +------+------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* Create a public synonym.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM syn2 FOR tbl1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

## Considerations

The following part describes the privileges required for creating different types of synonyms:

* To create a private synonym in your own schema, you must have the `CREATE SYNONYM` privilege.

* To create a private synonym in another user's schema, you must have the `CREATE ANY SYNONYM` privilege.

* To create a public synonym, you must have the `CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM` privilege.

* The object for which the synonym is created does not need to exist and you do not need to have privileges to access the object.

```sql
/*Create a user named synonym_user.*/
obclient> CREATE USER synonym_user IDENTIFIED BY synonym_user;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> GRANT CREATE ON *.* TO synonym_user;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO synonym_user;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

/*Connect to user synonym_user.*/
obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE SYNONYM syn1 FOR tbl1;
ERROR-00600: internal error code, arguments: -5036, Access denied; you need (at least one of) the CREATE SYNONYM privilege(s) for this operation

/*Grant the CREATE SYNONYM privilege to user synonym_user.*/
obclient> GRANT CREATE SYNONYM TO synonym_user;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE SYNONYM syn1 FOR tbl1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
