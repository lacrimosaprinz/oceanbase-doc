# CREATE VIEW

## Purpose

You can use this statement to create a view. By specifying the `OR REPLACE` clause, you can also replace an existing view.

In a database, views do not exist as tables, but are derived from the execution results of the `SELECT` statement specified in the `CREATE VIEW` statement. A view is derived each time the statement is used.

If the `FROM` clause references two or more tables or views, the view is called a join view. An updatable join view, also known as a modifiable join view, involves two or more base tables or views and allows DML operations. Updatable views are not limited by the `WITH READ ONLY` clause.

A view must meet several criteria to be updatable. For example, a general rule is that an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation on a join view can modify only one base table at a time.

## Syntax

```javascript
create_view_stmt:
  CREATE [OR REPLACE] [[NO] FORCE] VIEW view_name [(column_name_list)] AS select_stmt;

column_name_list:
    column_name [, column_name ...]
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OR REPLACE | Specifies to re-create a view that already exists by using a new definition.  |
| \[NO\] FORCE | If you want to create a view regardless of whether the base tables of the view or the referenced object types exist, or the owner of the schema containing the view has privileges on them, specify `FORCE`. If you want to create a view only when the view has base tables and the owner of the schema containing the view has privileges on them, specify `NOFORCE`. The default value is `NOFORCE`.  |
| view_name | The name of the view.  |
| select_stmt | A `SELECT` statement that defines a view. You can use this statement to query base tables or other views.  |
| column_name_list | The column names in the view, which must be unique, like those in a base table. By default, the column names retrieved by the `SELECT` statement are used as the column names in the view. You can also use the optional `column_name_list` clause to define column names for a view. Separate multiple column names with commas (,). The number of column names in `column_name_list` must be equal to the number of columns retrieved by the `SELECT` statement. The `SELECT` statement can directly reference the columns of a table. You can also use functions, constants, and operators in the statement to retrieve columns.  |

## Examples

Retrieve the `col1` and `col2` columns of the `tbl1` table to create a view named `view1`.

```javascript
obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE FORCE VIEW view1(vcol1, vcol2) AS SELECT col1, col2 FROM tbl1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
