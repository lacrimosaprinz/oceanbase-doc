# TRUNCATE TABLE

## Purpose

You can use this statement to truncate a specified table but retain the table structure, including the partitions of the table. Logically, this statement is equivalent to the `DELETE FROM` statement that is used to delete all rows.

To execute the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement, you must have the `DROP` privilege on the table. If you are not the owner of the table, you must have the `DROP ANY TABLE` privilege.

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement differs from the `DELETE FROM` statement in the following aspects:

* The `TRUNCATE TABLE` operation drops a table and creates it again. It is much faster than deleting data row by row, especially for large tables.

* The output of `TRUNCATE TABLE` always indicates that 0 rows were affected.

* When you use `TRUNCATE TABLE`, the table management program does not record the last `AUTO_INCREMENT` value, but resets it to zero.

* The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement cannot be executed during transactions or when the table is locked. Otherwise, an error is returned.

* If the table definition file is valid, you can use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to recreate the table as an empty table, even if the data or indexes are corrupted.

## Syntax

```sql
TRUNCATE [TABLE] [schema.]table_name;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| schema. | The schema. If `schema.` is omitted, the table is in the current schema by default.  |
| table_name | The table name.  |

## Examples

Truncate the `tb1` table.

```sql
obclient> TRUNCATE TABLE tbl1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
