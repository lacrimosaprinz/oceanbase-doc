# DELETE

## Purpose

You can use this statement to delete rows that meet the conditions from one or more tables.

## Syntax

```sql
DELETE [hint_options] [FROM] table_factor [ WHERE where_condition ]
    [{ RETURNING | RETURN } returning_exprs [ into_clause ]]

table_factor:
    {table_name | table_subquery | '(' table_reference ')' }

where_condition:
    expression

returning_exprs:
    projection_col_name [,projection_col_name ...]

into_clause:
    { INTO into_var_list | BULK COLLECT INTO into_var_list}

into_var_list:
    { USER_VARIABLE | ref_name } [, { USER_VARIABLE | ref_name }...]
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| hint_options | Optional. The hint options.  |
| table_factor | The name of the object from which rows need to be deleted. The object can be a base table, an updatable view, or a special subquery.  |
| where_condition | The condition that the rows to be deleted must meet.  |
| returning_exprs | Returns the projected column where the data is to be deleted.  |
| into_clause | Inserts the projected column where the data is to be deleted into the specified list.  |
| ref_name | The name of the variable.  |

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>A special subquery is similar to a subquery that defines an updatable view. These subqueries must not contain complex operators (such as <code>GROUP BY</code>, <code>DISTINCT</code>, and <code>WINDOW FUNCTION</code>). </p>
  </main>

## Examples

Create a table named `tbl1` and insert data into it.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl1(col1 INT PRIMARY KEY, col2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO tbl1 VALUES(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4);
Query OK, 4 rows affected
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
+------+------+
| COL1 | COL2 |
+------+------+
|    1 |    1 |
|    2 |    2 |
|    3 |    3 |
|    4 |    4 |
+------+------+
4 rows in set
```

* Single-table delete: Delete rows where `col1 = 2` from the `tbl1` table. The `col1` column is the primary key.

   ```sql
   obclient>DELETE FROM tbl1 WHERE col1 = 2;
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient>SELECT * FROM tbl1;
   +----+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +----+------+
   |  1 |    1 |
   |  3 |    3 |
   |  4 |    4 |
   +----+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

* Single-table delete: Use a subquery to delete data from a table.

   ```sql
   obclient> DELETE FROM (SELECT * FROM tbl1);
   Query OK, 4 rows affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
   Empty set
   ```

* Single-table delete: Delete data from a table, with the `RETURNING` clause specified in the statement.

   ```sql
   obclient> DELETE FROM tbl1 RETURNING col1;
   +----+
   | COL1 |
   +----+
   |  1 |
   |  2 |
   |  3 |
   |  4 |
   +----+
   4 rows in set

   obclient>SELECT * FROM t1;
   Empty set
   ```
