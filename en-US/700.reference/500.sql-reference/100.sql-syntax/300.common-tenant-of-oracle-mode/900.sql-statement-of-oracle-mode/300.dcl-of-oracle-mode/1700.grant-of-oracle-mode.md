# GRANT

## Purpose

System administrators can use this statement to grant object privileges, system privileges, and roles to users.

## Required privileges

To execute the `GRANT` statement, you need to have the privileges being granted, as well as the privilege to grant those privileges. For example, if you want to grant the `SELECT` privilege on table `tbl1` from user `user1` to user `user2`, make sure that `user1` has the `SELECT` privilege on table `tbl1`, as well as the privilege to grant the `SELECT` privilege on table `tbl1`.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>After you grant privileges to a user, the user needs to reconnect to OceanBase Database for the privileges to take effect.</p>
</main>

## Syntax

```sql
/* Grant object privileges. */
GRANT {obj_all_col_priv [, obj_all_col_priv...]} 
    ON obj_clause 
    TO {grant_user [, grant_user...]} 
    [WITH GRANT OPTION]

/* Grant system privileges or roles. */
GRANT obj_all_col_priv [, obj_all_col_priv...] 
    TO grantee_clause 
    [WITH ADMIN OPTION]

grantee_clause:  
      grant_user [, grant_user...] 
    | grant_user IDENTIFIED BY password

obj_all_col_priv:  
      role 
    | sys_and_obj_priv [(column_list)] 
    | ALL [PRIVILEGES] [(column_list)]
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| obj_all_col_priv | Specifies the privilege to be  granted. You can directly or indirectly grant privileges to users through granting permissions or roles. When granting multiple permissions to a user, separate the permission types with a comma (`,`). For specific permission types and their description, please refer to [Privilege types in Oracle mode](../../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/000.permission-classification-of-oracle-mode.md). |
| obj_clause | Specifies the object to which the privilege is granted. There are several ways to specify the object to be granted:<ul><li>Specify all objects, such as all databases and all tables (`*.*`).</li><li>Specify specific objects, such as a specific database (`db_name.*`), a specific table (`table_name`), or a specific table in a specific database (`db_name.table_name`).</li><li>Specify a directory object (`[DIRECTORY] relation_name`).</li></ul> |
| grant_user | Specifies the user or role to whom the privilege is to be granted. It can take the following values:<ul><li>`user [USER_VARIABLE]`: Grants the privilege to a specific user.</li><li>`CONNECT`: Grants the privilege to the CONNECT role.</li><li>`RESOURCE`: Grants the privilege to the RESOURCE role.</li><li>`PUBLIC`: Grants the privilege to the public role.</li></ul> |
| IDENTIFIED BY password | Specifies a password for the user to be granted privileges. The password provided here is in plaintext. After being stored in the `dba_users` table, it will be encrypted on the server-side. If the password contains special characters such as <code>~!@#%^&*_-+=\|(){}[]:;',.?/</code>, it should be enclosed in double quotation marks (<code>""</code>). |
| WITH GRANT OPTION | Specifies whether to enable privilege delegation. When privilege delegation is enabled, grant revocation extends to dependent users.  |
| WITH ADMIN OPTION | Specifies whether to enable admin privilege delegation. When admin privilege delegation is enabled, grant revocation does not extend to dependent users.  |
| role | Specifies the role to be granted, with the following possible values:<ul><li>`role_name`: Represents the name of a custom role.</li><li>`DBA`: Represents the database administrator role, which has complete database management permissions. Users granted the DBA role can perform any database operation.</li><li>`RESOURCE`: Represents the RESOURCE role.</li><li>`CONNECT`: Represents the CONNECT role.</li><li>`PUBLIC`: Represents the public role.</li></ul> |

## Examples

* Grant the `CREATE VIEW` privilege to user `user1` and allow the user to grant the same privilege to other users.
  
  ```shell
  obclient> GRANT CREATE VIEW TO user1 WITH ADMIN OPTION;
  ```

* Grant the `CONNECT` role to user `user1` and change the password for `user1`.
  
  ```shell
  obclient> GRANT CONNECT TO user1 IDENTIFIED by '********';
  ```

  Then, check the password of `user1` in the `dba_users` table. You will find that the password has been updated.

* Grant the `COMMENT ANY TABLE` privilege to the role `role1`.
  
  ```shell
  GRANT COMMENT ANY TABLE TO role1;
  ```
