# TRANSACTION

## Purpose

You can use this statement to start a transaction.

A database transaction is a series of operations performed as a logical unit of work. A transaction can be used to maintain the integrity of the database by ensuring that SQL operations in a batch are either all executed or none of them are executed.

Explicit transactions are user-defined or user-specified transactions. You can explicitly start a transaction by using the `BEGIN` or `BEGIN WORK` statement (alias of `START TRANSACTION`) and explicitly end the transaction by using the `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` statement.
  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Before committing a transaction, you can execute a <code>SELECT</code> statement to check whether the operations in the transaction have taken effect. </li>
    <li>Before a transaction is committed, the operations in this transaction are invisible to other sessions except the session of the current transaction. In other words, before a transaction is <code>committed</code>, only the session of the current transaction can read the latest results. </li>
    <li>To roll back the transaction, use <code>ROOLBACK</code> to replace <code>COMMIT</code>. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>

## Syntax

```sql
transaction_stmt:
      START TRANSACTION [READ ONLY | READ WRITE];
    | BEGIN [WORK];
    | COMMIT [WORK];
    | ROLLBACK [WORK];
    | SET TRANSACTION {READ ONLY | READ WRITE};
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| START TRANSACTION \[READ ONLY \| READ WRITE\] | Starts a transaction. After a transaction is started, the subsequent SQL DML statements (such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`) do not take effect until the transaction is explicitly committed.  <ul><li> The `READ ONLY` clause specifies that the transaction is started in read-only mode and modifications to the transaction are not allowed.    </li><li> The `READ WRITE` clause specifies that the transaction is started in read and write mode, which is the default mode. </li></ul> |
| BEGIN | `BEGIN` and `BEGIN WORK` are used as the alias of `START TRANSACTION`.  |
| COMMIT | Commits the current transaction.  |
| ROLLBACK | Rolls back the current transaction.  |
| SET TRANSACTION {READ ONLY \| READ WRITE} | Sets the current transaction to the `READ ONLY` or `READ WRITE` mode.  |

## Examples

Create a table named `tbl1`.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (id INT,name VARCHAR(10),num INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO tbl1 VALUES (1, 'a',100),(2, 'b',200),(3, 'a',50);
Query OK, 3 rows affected
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
+------+------+------+
| ID   | NAME | NUM  |
+------+------+------+
|    1 | a    |  100 |
|    2 | b    |  200 |
|    3 | a    |   50 |
+------+------+------+
3 rows in set
```

* Start the transaction, change `name` to `c` for the row where `id` is `3`, and insert one row. Commit the transaction and query the information about the `tbl1` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> START TRANSACTION;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> UPDATE tbl1 SET name = 'c' WHERE id = 3;
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

   obclient> INSERT INTO tbl1 VALUES (4, 'a', 30);
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient> COMMIT;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
   +------+------+------+
   | ID   | NAME | NUM  |
   +------+------+------+
   |    1 | a    |  100 |
   |    2 | b    |  200 |
   |    3 | c    |   50 |
   |    4 | a    |   30 |
   +------+------+------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

* Start the transaction, change `name` to `c` for the row where `id` is `3`, insert one row, and query the information about the `tbl1` table. Roll back the transaction and query the information about the `tbl1` table.

   ```sql
   obclient> BEGIN;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> UPDATE tbl1 SET name = 'c' WHERE id = 3;
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0

   obclient> INSERT INTO tbl1 VALUES (4, 'd', 300);
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
   +------+------+------+
   | ID   | NAME | NUM  |
   +------+------+------+
   |    1 | a    |  100 |
   |    2 | b    |  200 |
   |    3 | c    |   50 |
   |    4 | d    |  300 |
   +------+------+------+
   4 rows in set

   obclient> ROLLBACK ;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
   +------+------+------+
   | ID   | NAME | NUM  |
   +------+------+------+
   |    1 | a    |  100 |
   |    2 | b    |  200 |
   |    3 | a    |   50 |
   +------+------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```
