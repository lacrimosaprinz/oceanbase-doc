# Multi-table join statements

This topic describes the requirements and suggestions on multi-table join statements in OceanBase Database.

* We recommend that you use aliases in multi-table join queries and specify the aliases for referencing fields in the `SELECT` list. The aliases are in the database name.table name format.

   Example: `select a.cid from deposit_account.tbluser a where ...`

* We recommend that you do not use left outer joins, right outer joins, or full outer joins in your production systems.

* In a query that involves multi-table join, we recommend that you select the table with the smallest result set as the driving table.

* Do not write SQL statements with nested subqueries. We recommend that you rewrite the SQL statements that sequentially join tables.

* Avoid the generation of the Cartesian product during multi-table join. Cartesian product is generally caused by faulty logic design or omission of join conditions, which can result in performance issues.
