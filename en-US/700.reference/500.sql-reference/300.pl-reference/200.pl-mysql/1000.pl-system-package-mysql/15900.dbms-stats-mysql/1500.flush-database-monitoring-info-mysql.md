# FLUSH_DATABASE_MONITORING_INFO

The `FLUSH_DATABASE_MONITORING_INFO` procedure updates the memory monitoring information of all tables in the dictionary.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_STATS.FLUSH_DATABASE_MONITORING_INFO;
```

## Exceptions

The error code `ORA-20000` indicates that you do not have the required privileges.

## Considerations

`FLUSH_DATABASE_MONITORING_INFO` will immediately update related information in the `*_TAB_STATISTICS` and `*_IND_STATISTICS` views with no need to wait for periodic database updates. The `GATHER_*_STATS` procedure refreshes the monitoring information internally and therefore does not need to be called before statistics are collected.

## Examples

```sql
obclient> CALL DBMS_STATS.FLUSH_DATABASE_MONITORING_INFO;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
