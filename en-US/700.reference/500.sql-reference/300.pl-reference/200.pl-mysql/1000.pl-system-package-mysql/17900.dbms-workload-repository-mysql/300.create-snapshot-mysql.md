# CREATE_SNAPSHOT

The `CREATE_SNAPSHOT` procedure triggers the generation of a snapshot for a cluster and is available only in the sys tenant.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.CREATE_SNAPSHOT(
    flush_level  VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT 'TYPICAL'
);
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| flush_level | The type of the snapshot. Currently, only the `TYPICAL` type is supported, which specifies to periodically generate snapshots to collect most statistics.  |

## Considerations

Each time after you manually create a snapshot, the timer restarts. For example, assume that snapshots are created at the default interval of 1 hour:

```shell
At 12:21, the timer triggers the creation of a snapshot.
At 13:21, the timer triggers the creation of the next snapshot.
At 13:45, the user manually creates a snapshot.
At 14:45, the timer triggers the creation of the next snapshot.
```

## Examples

```shell
obclient [SYS]> CALL DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.CREATE_SNAPSHOT(flush_level => 'TYPICAL');
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
