# Overview

PL stored programs support cursors, whose syntax is the same as that of embedded SQL statements.

The cursor declaration must be prior to the handler declaration but after the variable and condition declaration. Characteristics of a cursor:

* Insensitive: Servers may or may not copy the result table of a cursor.

* Read-only: A cursor cannot be updated.

* Non-scrollable: A cursor can traverse rows only in one direction and cannot skip rows.
