# Limitations on server cursors

You can call the `mysql_stmt_attr_set()` function in the C API on a server to implement the cursor feature.

A server cursor can generate a result set on the server. Only the rows requested by the client are transferred to the client. For example, if the client executes a query to obtain the first row, other rows will not be transferred to the client.

Observe the following limitations:

* Cursors are read-only. You cannot use cursors to update rows. Therefore, `UPDATE WHERE CURRENT OF` and `DELETE WHERE CURRENT OF` are not supported.

* Cursors cannot be maintained. In other words, a cursor cannot maintain in the opened state after it is committed.

* Cursors are insensitive.

* Cursors are non-scrollable.

* Cursors cannot be named. You can use a statement handle to obtain the cursor ID.

* Each prepared statement can open only one cursor. The number of cursors is the same as the number of prepared statements.

* If the prepared mode does not support a statement that generates a result set, you cannot use a cursor in this statement. Such statements include `CHECK TABLE`, `HANDLER READ`, and `SHOW BINLOG EVENTS`.
