# IF

You can use the `IF` statement to build a basic conditional statement.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
IF search_condition THEN statement_list
    [ELSEIF search_condition THEN statement_list] ...
    [ELSE statement_list]
END IF
```

The `IF` statement can contain the `THEN`, `ELSE`, and `ELSEIF` clauses and ends with `END IF`.

If the evaluation result of `search_condition` is `True`, the statements in the `THEN` or `ELSEIF` clause are executed. If no `search_condition` expression has the value `True`, the `statement_list` in the `ELSE` clause is executed.

Each `statement_list` consists of one or more SQL statements and must not be empty.

The `IF ... END IF` block in a stored program must end with a semicolon (\;). Like other throttling constructs, the `IF ... END IF` block can be nested in other control statements, including the `IF` statement. Each `IF` statement must end with its own `END IF;`. You can indent the code to make the nested throttling block easier to read, as shown in the following example:

```sql
obclient> DELIMITER //

obclient> CREATE FUNCTION comp_fuc (n INT, m INT)
   RETURNS VARCHAR(50)

   BEGIN
     DECLARE x VARCHAR(50);

     IF n = m THEN SET x = 'Equal to';
     ELSE
       IF n > m THEN SET x = 'Greater than';
       ELSE SET x = 'Smaller than';
       END IF;

     END IF;

     SET x = CONCAT(n, ' ', x, ' ', m, '.');
     RETURN x;
   END //
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

In the preceding example, the internal `IF` statement is executed only when `n` is not equal to `m`.
