# LEAVE


You can use the `LEAVE` statement to exit a throttling statement with the specified label. If the label is used in the outermost stored program block, use the `LEAVE` statement to exit the program.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
LEAVE label
```

The `LEAVE` statement can be used in the `BEGIN ... END` block and the `LOOP`, `REPEAT`, and `WHILE` loop statements.
