# REPEAT


You can use the `REPEAT` statement to execute a statement repeatedly.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
[begin_label:] REPEAT
    statement_list
UNTIL search_condition
END REPEAT [end_label]
```


`statement_list` in the `REPEAT` statement is executed repeatedly until the result of the `search_condition` expression is `True`. Therefore, `REPEAT` will enter a loop at least once. `statement_list` consists of one or more SQL statements. Each SQL statement ends with a semicolon (;). You can use `label` to label a `REPEAT` statement.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> DELIMITER //

obclient> CREATE PROCEDURE rep_proc(p1 INT)
       BEGIN
         SET @x = 0;
         REPEAT
           SET @x = @x + 1;
         UNTIL @x > p1 END REPEAT;
       END
       //
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CALL rep_proc(100)//
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT @x//
+------+
| @x   |
+------+
| 101  |
+------+
1 row in set
```
