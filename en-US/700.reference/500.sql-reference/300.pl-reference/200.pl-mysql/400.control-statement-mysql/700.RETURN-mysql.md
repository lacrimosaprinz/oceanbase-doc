# RETURN


You can use the `RETURN` statement to end the execution of a stored function and return the result to the function invoker.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
RETURN expr
```

A stored function must contain at least one `RETURN` statement. If a function has multiple exit points, it may contain multiple `RETURN` statements.

Stored procedures and triggers do not use the `RETURN` statement but use the `LEAVE` statement to exit a program.
