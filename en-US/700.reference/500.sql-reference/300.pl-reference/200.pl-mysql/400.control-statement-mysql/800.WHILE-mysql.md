# WHILE

You can use the `WHILE` statement to build a basic conditional statement.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
[begin_label:] WHILE search_condition DO
    statement_list
END WHILE [end_label]
```

`statement_list` in the `WHILE` statement will be executed repeatedly provided that the result of the `search_condition` expression is `True`. `statement_list` consists of one or more SQL statements. Each SQL statement ends with a semicolon (\;). You can use `label` to label a `WHILE` statement.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> DELIMITER //

obclient> CREATE PROCEDURE while_proc()
   BEGIN
     DECLARE v1 INT DEFAULT 10;
     WHILE v1 > 0 DO
       SET v1 = v1 - 1;
     END WHILE;
   END //
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
