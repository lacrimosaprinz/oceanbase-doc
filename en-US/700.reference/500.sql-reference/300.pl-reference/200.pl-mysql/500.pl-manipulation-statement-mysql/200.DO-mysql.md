# DO

You can use the `DO` statement to execute an SQL expression without returning any result.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
DO expr [, expr ...]
```


In some scenarios, the `DO` statement is equivalent to the `SELECT expr` statement, which provides a quick response without returning a result. Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT SLEEP(5);
+----------+
| SLEEP(5) |
+----------+
|        0 |
+----------+
1 row in set (5.001 sec)

obclient> DO SLEEP(5);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (5.011 sec)
```
