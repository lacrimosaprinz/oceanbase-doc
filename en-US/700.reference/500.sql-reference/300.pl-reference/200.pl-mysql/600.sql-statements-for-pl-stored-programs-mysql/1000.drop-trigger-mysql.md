# DROP TRIGGER

You can use the `DROP TRIGGER` statement to drop a trigger.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER [IF EXISTS] [schema_name.]trigger_name
```

The `schema_name` parameter is optional. If the `schema_name` parameter is omitted, the trigger is dropped from the default schema. The `DROP TRIGGER` statement requires that the table associated with the trigger have the `TRIGGER` privilege.

If the trigger does not exist, you can use the `IF EXISTS` clause to avoid errors and generate a note for the trigger.

If a table is dropped, its triggers are also dropped.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS test_trg;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
