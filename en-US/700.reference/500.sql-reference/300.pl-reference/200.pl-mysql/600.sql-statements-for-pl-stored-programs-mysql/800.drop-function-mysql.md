# DROP FUNCTION

You can use the `DROP FUNCTION` statement to drop a stored function.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION [IF EXISTS] sp_name
```

To drop a stored routine, you must have the `ALTER ROUTINE` privilege on the routine.

If the stored function does not exist, you can use the `IF EXISTS` clause to avoid errors and generate a warning. You can use the `SHOW WARNINGS` statement to view the warning.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS my_func;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
