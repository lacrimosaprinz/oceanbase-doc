# DROP PROCEDURE

You can use the `DROP PROCEDURE` statement to drop a stored procedure.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
DROP PROCEDURE [IF EXISTS] sp_name
```

To drop a stored routine, you must have the `ALTER ROUTINE` privilege on the routine.

If the stored procedure does not exist, you can use the `IF EXISTS` clause to avoid errors and generate a warning. You can use the `SHOW WARNINGS` statement to view the warning.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS proc_name;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
