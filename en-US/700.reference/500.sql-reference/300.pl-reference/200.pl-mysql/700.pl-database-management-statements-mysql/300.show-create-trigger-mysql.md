# SHOW CREATE TRIGGER


You can use the `SHOW CREATE TRIGGER` statement to view the information about a trigger.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
SHOW CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name;
```


This statement requires that the table associated with the trigger have the `TRIGGER` privilege.

The output of the `SHOW CREATE TRIGGER` statement contains the following fields:

* `Trigger`: the name of the trigger.

* `sql_mode`: the SQL mode used when the trigger is executed.

* `SQL Original Statement`: the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement that defines the trigger.

* `character_set_client`: the value of the `character_set_client` system variable in the current session when the trigger was created.

* `collation_connection`: the value of the `collation_connection` system variable when the trigger was created.

* `Database Collation`: the collation of the database to which the trigger is associated.

* `Created`: the date and time when the trigger was created. The type of the value is `TIMESTAMP(2)` (with the fractional part in hundredth seconds).


You can also obtain the information about a trigger from the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA TRIGGERS` table. For more information, see [INFORMATION_SCHEMA TRIGGERS](../800.information-schema-dictionary-view-mysql/300.information-schema-triggers-mysql.md).

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SHOW CREATE TRIGGER test_trg;
