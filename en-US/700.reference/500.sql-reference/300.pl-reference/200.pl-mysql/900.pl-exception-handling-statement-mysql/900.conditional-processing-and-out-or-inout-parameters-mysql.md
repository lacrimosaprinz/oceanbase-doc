# Exception handling and OUT/INOUT parameters

In some exception handling scenarios, a stored program does not return the modified values of the `OUT` and `INOUT` parameters to the caller.

If the stored procedure exits due to an unhandled exception, the modified values of its `OUT` and `INOUT` parameters are not returned to the caller.

If the exception handler is a `CONTINUE` or `EXIT` handler containing a `RESIGNAL` statement, the diagnostics area stack is popped during the execution of `RESIGNAL`. This in turn signals the exception, which is the information that existed before the handler is entered. If the exception is an error, the values of the `OUT` and `INOUT` parameters are not returned to the caller.
