Quote identifiers
==========================

When you reference identifiers, you can use simple, qualified, and remote names or qualified and remote names.

If you declare an identifier in a named PL unit, you can, and sometimes must, reference it by using its qualified name. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
unit_name.simple_identifier_name
```



For example, if you declare identifier `c` in the `ob` package, you can use the qualified name `ob.c` to reference the identifier. Unit names can, and sometimes must, be qualified as well. If an identifier is invisible, it must be qualified. For more information, see [Scope and visibility of identifiers](../100.pl-language-basics-oracle/500.range-and-visibility-of-identifiers-oracle.md).

If you use an identifier to name an object on a remote database, you must reference the identifier with its remote name. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
simple_identifier_name@link_to_remote_database
```



If an identifier is declared in a PL unit on a remote database, you must reference the identifier with its qualified remote name. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
unit_name.simple_identifier_name@link_to_remote_database
```
