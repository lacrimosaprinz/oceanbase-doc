Assign values
=======================

After you declare variables, you can assign values to the variables by using different methods.

Use one of the following methods to assign values:

* Use the value assignment statement to specify values of expressions for variables.



* Use the `SELECT INTO` or `FETCH` statement to assign values to variables.



* Pass variables as `OUT` or `IN OUT` parameters to subprograms, and assign values to the variables in the subprograms.






The data types of the variables must be compatible with those of the values. If a data type can be implicitly converted to another data type, the two data types are compatible.

Use value assignment statements to assign values to variables
--------------------

After you declare variables, you can use value assignment statements to specify values of expressions for the variables.

PL uses `:=` to assign values by using the following syntax:

```sql
variable  := expression ;
```



`variable` specifies the PL variable, and `expression` specifies the PL expression.

Example: Use a value assignment statement to assign a value to a variable.

```sql
obclient> DECLARE
     pi     CONSTANT NUMBER := 3.14159;
     radius NUMBER NOT NULL := 1;
     area   NUMBER := (pi * radius**2);
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The area of the circle is '||area);
END;
/
Query OK, 0 rows affected

The area of the circle is 3.14159
```



In the example, the `pi`, `radius`, and `area` variables are declared, and initial values are specified for `pi` and `radius`. A value assignment statement is used to specify a value of an expression for the `area` variable.

Use the SELECT INTO statement to assign values to variables
-------------------------------

You can use the `SELECT INTO` statement to directly assign values to variables. Value assignment will be implemented once each time the `SELECT INTO` statement is executed. The types of variables to which values are to be assigned must be in one-to-one mapping with the columns in `SELECT`.

The `SELECT INTO` statement can be simplified as follows:

```javascript
SELECT select_item [, select_item ]...
INTO variable_name [, variable_name ]...
FROM table_name;
```



Each `select_item` must have one corresponding `variable_name` whose type is compatible with that of select_item. SQL does not support the `BOOLEAN` type, so the value of `variable_name` cannot be of the `BOOLEAN` type.

Example: Use the `SELECT INTO` statement to assign values to variables.

```javascript
obclient> CREATE TABLE employees(
   employee_id    NUMBER(4,0),  
   name           VARCHAR(10),  
   salary         NUMBER(7,2)
  );
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO employees (employee_id,name,salary)VALUES(105,'Sam Smith',15000);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> DECLARE
    emp_id      employees.employee_id%TYPE :=105;
    emp_name    employees.name%TYPE;
    wages       employees.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
    SELECT name, NVL(salary,0) INTO emp_name, wages
    FROM employees WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp_name||'----'||to_char(wages));
END;
/
Query OK, 0 rows affected

Sam Smith----15000
```





Assign values to variables that are passed to subprograms as parameters
----------------------

If you pass a variable as an `OUT` or `IN OUT` parameter to a subprogram and the subprogram has assigned a value to the parameter, the value retains after the variable is executed in the subprogram.

Example: Assign a value to a variable that is passed to a subprogram as a parameter.

```javascript
obclient> DECLARE
  wages   employees.salary%TYPE;

  PROCEDURE new_salary (
    emp_id        employees.employee_id%TYPE :=105,
    salary    IN OUT NUMBER,
    add_salary    NUMBER
  ) IS
  BEGIN
    salary := salary + add_salary;
  END;

BEGIN
  SELECT salary INTO wages
  FROM employees
  WHERE employee_id = 105;

  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE
   ('The original wages is ' || wages);

  new_salary (105, wages, 1000); -- Call the procedure

  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE
   ('The new wages is ' || wages);
END;
/
 Query OK, 0 rows affected

The original wages is 15000 -- Before the procedure is called
The new wages is 16000 -- After the procedure is called
```



Assign values to BOOLEAN variables
-----------------------

`BOOLEAN` values support logic operations. `BOOLEAN` variables can be set only to `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NULL`.

Example: Assign a value to a `BOOLEAN` variable.

```javascript
obclient> DECLARE
  done BOOLEAN;     -- By default, the initial value is NULL.
BEGIN
    done := FALSE;  -- Specify the value of the literal.
    WHILE NOT done LOOP
        Null;
        done := TRUE;
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```
