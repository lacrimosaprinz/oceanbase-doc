# Expressions

An expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and SQL evaluation functions. An expression always returns a single value.

Expressions can be categorized into the following types by complexity:

* Single constant or variable, for example, `c`



* Unary operator with a single operand, for example, `-c`



* Binary operator with two operands, for example, `a + b`






Objects such as variables, constants, literals, operators, function calls, placeholders, and other expressions can be used as operands. The data type of an operand decides the data type of the expression. Each time when you evaluate an expression, a single value of the data type will be produced. The data type of the result indicates the data type of the expression.

Concatenation operator
--------------

You can use the concatenation operator (\|\|) to connect two strings.

The concatenation operator ignores the `null` operand.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> DECLARE
  a VARCHAR2(10) := 'Ocean';
  b VARCHAR2(10) := 'Base';
BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (a || NULL || NULL|| b);
END;
/
Query OK, 0 rows affected

OceanBase
```



Operator precedence
---------------

An operation can be a unary operator with a single operand or a binary operator with two operands. Expressions are evaluated based on the operator precedence.

Do not embed any other characters between operators, including space characters.

The following table lists operators in descending order of precedence. For operators of the same precedence, the evaluation order is not specified.


| **Operator** | **Name** |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| \*\* | The exponentiation operator. |
| +, - | The identity operator and negation operator. |
| \*, / | The multiplication operator and division operator. |
| +, -, \|\| | The addition operator, subtraction operator, and concatenation operator. |
| =, \<, \>, \<=, \>=, \<\>, !=, \~=, \^=, IS NULL, LIKE, BETWEEN, IN | Comparison operators. |
| NOT | The negation operator. |
| AND | The logical AND operator. |
| OR | The logical OR operator. |



You can use parentheses to control the operation sequence of operators in an expression. Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> DECLARE
  x INTEGER := 1+2*3+2**2;
  y INTEGER := (1+2*3+2)**2;
  z INTEGER := ((1+2)*3+2)**2;
BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('x = ' || x);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('y = ' || y);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('z = ' || z);
END;
/
Query OK, 0 rows affected

x = 11
y = 81
z = 121
```



Logical operators
--------------

Logical operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` follow the three-state logic. `AND` and `OR` are binary operators, and `NOT` is a unary operator.

The PL operators of OceanBase Database include common operators, comparison operators, and logical operators.

The following table describes the logical operators.


| **Operator** | **Description** |
|---------|------------------------------|
| IS NULL | The operator that determines whether a value is null. |
| AND | The logical AND operator. |
| OR | The logical OR operator. |
| NOT | The negation operator. For example, you can use it in `IS NOT NULL` and `NOT IN`. |



Logical operators return values in the following logic:

* When and only when two operands are `TRUE`, `AND` returns `TRUE`.



* If any operand is `TRUE`, `OR` returns `TRUE`.



* Unless the operand is `NULL`, `NOT` returns a value opposite to the operand. `NOT NULL` returns `NULL`, because `NULL` is an indeterminate value.






Short-circuit evaluation
-------------

PL uses short-circuit evaluation to evaluate a logical expression. In this way, PL can stop evaluating the expression immediately after the result is determined.

Short-circuit evaluation can avoid division by zero in `OR` expressions. When the value of `a` is 0 and the value of the left operand is `TRUE`, PL does not evaluate the right operand. If PL has evaluated two operands before it applies the `OR` operator, the right operand results in the division-by-zero error.

```javascript
obclient> DELIMITER $$ -- The delimiter is redefined, because the expression contains a slash (/).
obclient> DECLARE
  a  INTEGER := 0;
  b  INTEGER := 20;
BEGIN
  IF (a = 0) OR ((b / a) < 5) THEN  -- If the evaluation stops after the first expression is executed, the division-by-zero error will not occur.
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The output is zero.');
  END IF;
END;
$$
Query OK, 0 rows affected

The output is zero.
```



Comparison operators
--------------

A comparison operator compares an expression with another expression. The evaluation result is always `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NULL`.

If the value of an expression is `NULL`, the evaluation result is `NULL` as well.

The following table lists comparison operators supported by PL.


| **Operator** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|--------|
| = | The equal operator. |
| \<\> , != , \~= , \^= | The not equal operator. |
| \< | The less than operator. |
| \> | The greater than operator. |
| \<= | The less than or equal operator. |
| \>= | The greater than or equal operator. |
| BETWEEN AND | The operator that determines whether a value is within a range of values. |
| IN | The operator that determines whether a value is within a set of values. |
| IS \<NOT\> NULL | The operator that determines whether a value is null. |
| LIKE | The pattern matching operator. |



**IS [NOT\] NULL operator**

If the operand of the `IS NULL` operator is `NULL`, the `BOOLEAN` value `TRUE` is returned. Otherwise, `FALSE` is returned. The `IS NOT NULL` operator operates in the opposite way. The results of comparisons involving the `NULL` value are always `NULL`.

**Relational operators**

Relational operators include arithmetic comparisons, `BOOLEAN` comparisons, character comparisons, and date comparisons.

* Arithmetic comparisons

   A number indicates a larger quantity is greater. Real numbers are stored as approximate values. Therefore, we recommend that you make equality or inequality comparisons.




* `BOOLEAN` comparisons

   `TRUE` is greater than `FALSE` by definition. The results of comparisons with `NULL` are always `NULL`.






* Character comparisons

   By default, a character with a larger binary value is greater.





* Date comparisons

   A later date is greater than an earlier date.





**LIKE operator**

You can use the `LIKE` operator to compare the value of a character, string, or `CLOB` with a pattern. If the value matches the pattern, `TRUE` is returned. Otherwise, `FALSE` is returned.

This pattern can include two wildcard characters: an underscore (\_) and a percent sign (%). The underscore (\_) matches one character. The percent sign (%) matches zero or multiple characters.

To search for an underscore (\_) or a percent sign (%), define an escape character and place it before the underscore (\_) or percent sign (%).

Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> DECLARE
  PROCEDURE compare (
    name     VARCHAR2,
    customer VARCHAR2
  ) IS
  BEGIN
    IF name LIKE customer THEN
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('TRUE');
    ELSE
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('FALSE');
    END IF;
  END;
BEGIN
  compare('ZhangSan', 'Zhang%S_n');
  compare('ZhangSan', 'zhang%s_n');
END;
/
Query OK, 0 rows affected

TRUE
FALSE
```



In the example, `ZhangSan` matches the pattern 'Zhang%S_n', so `TRUE` is returned. It does not match the pattern 'zhang%s_n', so `FALSE` is returned.

**BETWEEN operator**

You can use the `BETWEEN` operator to determine whether a value is within a specified range.

The value of the `c BETWEEN a AND b` expression is the same as that of the `(c>= a)AND(c<= b)` expression. The value of the `x` expression is evaluated only once.

Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE output_bool (
  bool_name   VARCHAR2,
  bool_value  BOOLEAN
) AUTHID DEFINER IS
BEGIN
  IF bool_value IS NULL THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (bool_name || ' = NULL');
  ELSIF bool_value = TRUE THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (bool_name || ' = TRUE');
  ELSE
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (bool_name || ' = FALSE');
  END IF;
END;
/
obclient>BEGIN
  output_bool ('8 BETWEEN 7 AND 9', 8 BETWEEN 7 AND 9);
  output_bool ('8 BETWEEN 7 AND 8', 8 BETWEEN 7 AND 8);
  output_bool ('8 BETWEEN 5 AND 6', 8 BETWEEN 5 AND 6);
END;
/
Query OK, 0 rows affected

8 BETWEEN 7 AND 9 = TRUE
8 BETWEEN 7 AND 8 = TRUE
8 BETWEEN 5 AND 6 = FALSE
```



**IN operator**

You can use the `IN` operator to determine whether a value belongs to a set. Only when `x` is equal to a `set` member, `x IN(set)` returns `TRUE`.

Here is an example:

```javascript
DECLARE
  familyname VARCHAR2(10) := 'Zhang';
BEGIN
  output_bool (
    'familyname IN (''Zhao'', ''Qian'', ''Sun'', ''Li'')',
    familyname IN ('Zhao', 'Qian', 'Sun', 'Li')
  );
  output_bool (
    'familyname IN (''He'', ''Lv'', ''Shi'', ''Zhang'')',
    familyname IN ('He', 'Lv', 'Shi', 'Zhang')
  );
END;
/
Query OK, 0 rows affected

familyname IN ('Zhao', 'Qian', 'Sun', 'Li') = FALSE
familyname IN ('He', 'Lv', 'Shi', 'Zhang') = TRUE
```



BOOLEAN expressions
--------------------

A `BOOLEAN` expression returns an expression whose `BOOLEAN` value is `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NULL`.

The simplest `BOOLEAN` expression is a `BOOLEAN` literal, constant, or variable.

Generally, `BOOLEAN` expressions are used as conditions in control statements and conditions in the `WHERE` clauses of DML statements.

You can use `BOOLEAN` variables as conditions without comparing them with `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

Here is an example:

```javascript
DECLARE
  a BOOLEAN := FALSE;
BEGIN
  -- The following three WHILE loops are equivalent.

  WHILE a = FALSE
    LOOP
      a := TRUE;
    END LOOP;

  WHILE NOT (a = TRUE)
    LOOP
      a := TRUE;
    END LOOP;

  WHILE NOT a
    LOOP
      a := TRUE;
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```



CASE expressions
-----------------

**Simple CASE expressions**

The simplest `CASE` statement evaluates the value of a single expression and compares the value with multiple potential values.

The syntax is as follows:

```javascript
CASE selector
  WHEN selector_value_1 THEN result_1
  WHEN selector_value_2 THEN result_2 ...
  WHEN selector_value_n THEN result_n
  [ ELSE
        else_statements ]
  END
CASE;
```



`selector` is an expression. Generally, it is a variable. Each `selector_value` and each `result` can be literals or expressions. At least one `result` cannot be `NULL`.

A simple `CASE` expression returns the first `result` where `selector_value` matches `selector`. Remaining expressions are no longer evaluated. If no `selector_value` matches `selector`, the `CASE` expression returns `else_result`, if any. Otherwise, the expression returns `NULL`.

Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> DECLARE
    grade CHAR(1);
BEGIN
   grade := 'B';
    CASE grade
      WHEN 'A' THEN DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('PASS');
      WHEN 'B' THEN DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SUSPEND');
      WHEN 'C' THEN DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('FAIL');
      ELSE DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No such grade');
      END CASE;
END;
 /
Query OK, 0 rows affected

SUSPEND
```



**Searched CASE expressions**

In a searched `CASE` statement, `CASE` is not followed by any expression that needs to be evaluated, but `WHEN` is followed by different BOOLEAN expressions. The searched `CASE` statement evaluates the values of several BOOLEAN expressions and selects the first branch whose result is `TRUE`.

The searched `CASE` expression has the following syntax:

```javascript
CASE
    WHEN boolean_expression_1 THEN result_1
    WHEN boolean_expression_2 THEN result_2 ...
    WHEN boolean_expression_n THEN result_n
  [ ELSE
   else_result ]
END CASE;
```



The searched `CASE` statement executes the first `boolean_expression` whose `result` is `TRUE`. Remaining `boolean_expressions` are not executed. If no `boolean_expression` whose result is `TRUE`, `else_result`, if any, is returned. If `else_result` does not exist, `NULL` is returned.

The following example shows a searched `CASE` expression that corresponds to a simple `CASE` expression:

```javascript
obclient> DECLARE
    grade CHAR(1);
BEGIN
    grade := 'D';
      CASE
       WHEN grade = 'A' THEN DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('PASS');
       WHEN grade = 'B' THEN DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SUSPEND');
       WHEN grade = 'C' THEN DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('FAIL');
       ELSE DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('UNEXPECTED');
     END CASE;
END;
/
Query OK, 0 rows affected

UNEXPECTED
```



SQL functions in PL expressions
------------------------

In PL expressions, all SQL functions can be used, except the following functions:

* Aggregate functions such as `AVG` and `COUNT`



* Analytic functions such as `LAG` and `RATIO_TO_REPORT`



* Data mining functions such as `CLUSTER_ID` and `FEATURE_VALUE`

Static expressions
--------------

A static expression is an expression with a determinate value during compilation. Therefore, it does not include character comparisons, variables, or function calls. Only static expressions can be applied to conditional compilation directives.

An expression can be considered a static expression when it meets the following requirements:

* The literal value of the expression is `NULL`.



* The expression is a character, numeric, or BOOLEAN literal.



* The expression references a static constant.



* The expression references a conditional compilation variable that starts with `$$`.



* The expression is an operator supported by a static expression, all operands in the expression are static, and no exception is caused when the operator evaluates the operands.






The following table lists the operators supported by static expressions.


| **Operator** | **Description** |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| () | An expression delimiter. |
| \*\* | An exponentiation operator. |
| \*, /,+, - | Arithmetic operators: multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. |
| =, !=, \<, \<=, \>=, \> IS \[NOT\] NULL | Comparison operators. |
| NOT | Logical operators. |
| \[NOT\] LIKE, \[NOT\] LIKE2, \[NOT\] LIKE4, \[NOT\] LIKEC | Pattern matching operators. |
| XOR | A binary operator. |



Static expressions support the following functions:

* ABS



* ACOS



* ASCII



* ASCIISTR

* SUBSTRB



* SUBSTRC



* TAN



* TANH



* TO_BINARY_DOUBLE



* TO_BINARY_FLOAT



* TO_CHAR



* TO_NUMBER



* TRIM



* TRUNC



* UPPER






Static expressions can be used to declare the following subtypes:

* Lengths of string types such as `VARCHAR2`, `NCHAR`, `CHAR`, `NVARCHAR2`, `RAW`, and `ANSI`



* Range and precision of the `NUMBER` type and subtypes, for example, `FLOAT`



* Precision of the interval type, such as year, month, and second



* Time and timestamp precision



* `VARRAY` bounds



* Range bounds in type declarations






Under any circumstances, the resulting type of a static expression must be the same as the subtype of the declared item and must be within the correct range of the context.

**PLS_INTEGER static expressions**

`PLS_INTEGER` static expressions include:

* `PLS_INTEGER` literals

* `PLS_INTEGER` static constants

* `NULL`






**BOOLEAN static expressions**

`BOOLEAN` static expressions include:

* `BOOLEAN` literals. The value can be `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NULL`.



* `BOOLEAN` static constants



* `PLS_INTEGER` static expressions represented by `x` and `y` in the following expressions:

   * x > y
   * x < y
   * x >= y
   * x <= y
   * x = y
   * x <> y

* BOOLEAN expressions represented by `x` and `y` in the following expressions:

   * NOT y
   * x AND y
   * x OR y
   * x > y
   * x >= y
   * x = y
   * x <= y
   * x <> y

* Static expressions represented by `x` in the following expressions:

   * x IS NULL
   * x IS NOT NULL



**VARCHAR2 static expressions**

`VARCHAR2` static expressions include:

* String literals, with a maximum size of 32,767 bytes



* Null values



* `TO_CHAR (x)`, where `x` is a `PLS_INTEGER` static expression



* `TO_CHAR (x, f, n)`, where `x` is a `PLS_INTEGER` static expression, and `f` and `n` are `VARCHAR2` static expressions



* `x || y`, where `x` and `y` are `VARCHAR2` or `PLS_INTEGER` static expressions.






**Static constants**

A static constant is declared in a package by using the following syntax:

```javascript
constant_name CONSTANT data_type := static_expression;
```



The type of `static_expression` must be the same as the value of `data_type`, which can be `BOOLEAN` or `PLS_INTEGER`.

Even in the body of the `package_name` package, static constants must always be referenced in the format of `package_name.constant_name`.

If the conditional compile directive in a PL unit uses the `constant_name` constant in a `BOOLEAN` expression, the PL unit depends on the `package_name` package. If the program specification is modified, the dependent PL unit may become invalid and needs to be recompiled.

If you use a package that contains static constants to control conditional compilation in multiple PL units, we recommend that you create only the package specification and use it exclusively for conditional compilation control. This can prevent the program package from becoming invalid due to modifications to the package specification.
