# CREATE TYPE

You can use the `CREATE TYPE` statement to specify the name, method, and other attributes of a type.

    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>
  </main>

You can use the `CREATE TYPE` statement to create or replace the specifications of the following types:

* Abstract data type (ADT)

* Independent variable array (VARRAY) type

* Independent nested table type

* Incomplete object type

   An incomplete object type is a type created by using a forward type definition. An incomplete object type has a name but no attributes or methods. It can be referenced by other types and can be used to define types that reference each other.  However, you must first create a complete type before you use it to create table columns, object columns, or nested table columns.

The `CREATE TYPE BODY` statement is built in with the code for implementing the type.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>If you create a type whose specification declares only attributes but no methods, you do not need to create the type body. </li>
    <li>You can use the <code>CREATE TYPE</code> statement to create nested tables and VARRAY types, but cannot create associative arrays. Within a PL block or package, three collection types can be defined.</li>
    </ul>
  </main>


## Prerequisites

To create a type in your own schema, you must have the `CREATE TYPE` system privilege. To create a type in the schema of other users, you must have the `CREATE ANY TYPE` system privilege. You can obtain these privileges directly or through roles.

The owner of a type must be explicitly granted the `EXECUTE` object privilege or the `EXECUTE ANY TYPE` system privilege, to access all other types referenced in the definition of this type. The owner of a type cannot obtain these privileges through roles.

If the owner of a type wants to grant other users the access privilege on this type, the type owner must first be granted the `EXECUTE` object privilege by using `GRANT OPTION`, or the `EXECUTE ANY TYPE` system privilege by using `ADMIN OPTION`. Otherwise, the type owner does not have sufficient privileges to grant other users the access privilege on this type.

## Semantics


| Syntax | Keyword or syntax node | Description |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| create_type_stmt | OR REPLACE | Re-creates this type (if any) and recompiles it.  Before the type is redefined, users granted the access privilege can still access this type without the need to obtain the access privilege again. If any function-based index depends on this type, the database marks this index as DISABLED.  |
| plsql_type_spec_source | pl_schema_name | The name of the schema containing the type.  The default value is your own schema.  |
| plsql_type_spec_source | TYPE | The ADT name, nested table type, or VARRAY type.  |
| plsql_type_spec_source | varray_type_def | Creates a type as an orderly set of elements of the same data type.  |
| plsql_type_spec_source | nested_table_type_def | Creates a nested table of the type specified by `datatype`.  |
| object_type_def | object_type_def | Creates an ADT. The variables that form the data structure are referred to as attributes. Member subprograms that define ADT behaviors are referred to as methods.  You need to use the `AS OBJECT` keyword when you create an ADT.  |
| object_type_def | AS OBJECT | Creates a schema-level ADT. A schema-level ADT is sometimes referred to as a root ADT.  |
| attr_and_element_spec | element_spec | Specifies each attribute of the ADT.  |
| subprogram_spec | subprogram_spec | Declares a subprocedure.  |
| subprogram_spec | member_or_static | <ul><li> `MEMBER`: Functions or stored procedures that are associated with an ADT are referred to as member functions. Generally, the body that calls the MEMBER method has an implicit first parameter, namely, SELF. This parameter indicates the object that calls this method.    </li><li> `STATIC`: The function or stored procedure associated with the ADT. Unlike the `MEMBER` method, the `STATIC` method does not have any implicit parameter. You cannot reference the `SELF` parameter in the body. The general call format is `type_name.method()`.  </li></ul> |
| subprogram_spec | proc_or_func_spec | Specifies the parameter and data type of the stored procedure or function. If this subprocedure does not contain the definition of the stored procedure or function, you must use the `CREATE TYPE BODY` statement to make the definition.  If you want to create a subtype, the name of the stored procedure or function cannot be the same as the name (regardless of whether it is inherited) of any attribute declared in the supertype link.  |
