===================================

You can use the `DROP PROCEDURE` statement to drop an independent stored procedure from OceanBase Database.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>  
    <p>Do not use this statement to drop stored procedures from program packages. To drop a stored procedure from a program package, use the <code>DROP PACKAGE</code> statement to drop the entire program package, or use a <code>CREATE PACKAGE</code> statement with an <code>OR REPLACE</code> clause to redefine a program package without this stored procedure. </p>
  </main>

Prerequisites
-------------------------

The stored procedure must be located in your own schema, or you must have the `ALTER ANY PROCEDURE` system privilege.

Syntax
-----------------------

The syntax of `drop_procedure` is as follows:

```sql
DROP PROCEDURE [ schema. ] procedure ;
```



Semantics
-----------------------



| Syntax | Keyword or syntax node | Description |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| drop_procedure | schema | The name of the schema where the stored procedure is located. The default value is your schema.  |
| drop_procedure | procedure_name | The name of the stored procedure to be dropped.  When a stored procedure is dropped, the database invalidates all local objects that are dependent on this stored procedure. If any of these objects is referenced later, the database attempts to recompile this object. If the dropped stored procedure has not been re-created, the database returns an error message.  |



Examples
-----------------------

Drop the stored procedure named `userlogin`.

```sql
DROP PROCEDURE userlogin;
```
