# ALTER TRIGGER

You can use the `ALTER TRIGGER` statement to enable, disable, compile, or rename a trigger.

  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode.
  </main>

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>  
    <p>This statement will not modify the existing declaration or definition of a trigger. To redeclare or redefine a trigger, use the <code>OR REPLACE</code> clause in the <code>CREATE TRIGGER</code> statement. </p>
  </main>

Prerequisites
-------------------------

If the trigger is in the schema of the `SYS` user, you must connect to the database with the `SYSDBA` role. Otherwise, the trigger must be located in your own schema, or you must have the `ALTER ANY TRIGGER` system privilege.

In addition, to modify a trigger in the database, you must have the `ADMINISTER DATABASE TRIGGER` system privilege.

Syntax
-----------------------

The syntax of `alter_trigger` is as follows:

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER [ schema. ] trigger_name
     COMPILE
    |{ ENABLE | DISABLE }
 ;
```



Semantics
-----------------------

| Syntax | Keyword or syntax node | Description |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| alter_trigger | schema | The name of the schema where the trigger is located. The default value is your schema.  |
| alter_trigger | trigger_name | The name of the trigger to be recompiled.  |
| alter_trigger | \[ ENABLE \| DISABLE \] | Enables or disables a trigger.  |
| alter_trigger | COMPILE | Recompiles the trigger regardless of whether the trigger is valid. If the trigger depends on an invalid object, the database recompiles the object. If the trigger recompilation succeeds, the trigger is validated. Otherwise, an error is returned and the trigger remains invalid. The execution environment of a trigger is determined when you create the trigger. During recompilation, the database removes all persistent switch settings of the compiler, reuses the environment on the session, and updates the system tables.  |



Examples
-----------------------

Example 1: Disable the `del_new_region` trigger.

A trigger named `del_new_region` is created in a table named `regions` in the schema of the `SYS` user. Each time when a `DELETE` operation is performed on the `regions` table, the trigger is fired, and the records whose values of `region_id` are greater than 3 are moved to the `reg_his` table. After you create this trigger, the database automatically enables it. Then, you can use the following statement to disable the trigger:

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER del_new_region DISABLE;
```



Example 2: Enable the `del_new_region` trigger.

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER del_new_region ENABLE;
```



After the trigger is enabled, it fires each time when a `DELETE` operation is performed on the `regions` table.


Example 3: Recompile the `del_new_region` trigger.

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER del_new_region COMPILE;
```
