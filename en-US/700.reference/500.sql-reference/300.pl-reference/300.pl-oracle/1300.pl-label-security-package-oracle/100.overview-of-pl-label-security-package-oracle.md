A label security policy has a set of standard components, including:

* Label

   This component contains labels for data and users, as well as authorizations for users and program units. It manages access to specified protected objects. Labels contain only levels in the current version. A level indicates the sensitivity assigned to a row, for example, `SENSITIVE` or `HIGHLY SENSITIVE`.


* Policy

   A policy is the name that is associated with the labels, rules, authorizations, and protected tables.


The following table describes the label security management packages supported by the current OceanBase Database version.
