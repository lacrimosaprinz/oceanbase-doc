# PUT_LINE

# docslug#/oceanbase-database/oceanbase-database/V4.0.0/PUT_LINE
The `PUT_LINE` stored procedure puts a single line in the buffer.

  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>
  </main>

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (
item IN VARCHAR2);
```



## Parameters



| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|--------|--------|
| item | The line to buffer.  |



## Considerations

* You can build a line piece by piece by calling `PUT` several times, or place an entire line in the buffer by calling `PUT_LINE`.



* When you call `PUT_LINE`, an end-of-line marker is automatically added. If the line is created by `PUT`, you must add an end-of-line marker by calling `NEW_LINE`. The `GET_LINE` and `GET_LINES` stored procedures do not return lines that are not terminated by line breaks.



* You will receive an error message if your lines exceed the line limit.



* The output that you create by using `PUT` or `PUT_LINE` is buffered. The output cannot be retrieved until the PL program unit from which it was buffered returns to its caller.

   For example, OBClient does not display `DBMS_OUTPUT` messages until the PL program completes. PL programs do not have any mechanism for flushing the `DBMS_OUTPUT` buffers.

   ```sql
   obclient> SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
   obclient> BEGIN
       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('hello');
       DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP (10);
       END;
   ```
