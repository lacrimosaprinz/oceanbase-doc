# DISABLE

The `DISABLE` procedure disables a program or job.

When a Scheduler object is disabled, the `enabled` attribute of the object is set to `FALSE`.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_SCHEDULER.DISABLE (
job_name              IN VARCHAR2,
force                 IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
commit_semantics      IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT 'STOP_ON_FIRST_ERROR');
```

## Parameters


| Parameter | Description |
|------------------|--------------------|
| job_name | The name of the job to disable. You can specify a list of names separated with commas (,). If you specify a job class name, all jobs in the class are disabled, but the job class itself is not disabled. If you specify a group name, the group is disabled, but the status of the members in the group is not affected.  |
| force | If you set this parameter to `TRUE`, the object is disabled even if other objects depend on it.  |
| commit_semantics | The commit semantics.  The following types are supported: <ul><li> `STOP_ON_FIRST_ERROR`: The procedure returns the message of the first error it encounters, and commits previous successful disable operations to the disk. This is the default setting.    </li><li> `TRANSACTIONAL`: The procedure returns the message of the first error it encounters, and rolls back all transactions before the error. This type is supported only when a job or a list of jobs is to be disabled. In addition, if you set the `force` parameter to `TRUE`, this type is not supported.    </li><li>`ABSORB_ERRORS`: The procedure ignores all errors and disables the rest of the jobs. It commits all successful disable operations. This type is supported only when a job or a list of jobs is to be disabled. </li></ul> |



## Considerations

If you disable an object that has been disabled, no error is returned.

The `force` parameter is provided only to identify dependencies and does not change the dependent objects.

After you disable a job, the job does not run or is not processed even if the metadata of the job exists. When a job is disabled, its status in the job queue changes to `disabled`. If you set the `force` parameter of a running job to `FALSE`, an error is returned. If you set the `force` parameter to `TRUE`, the job is disabled, but the currently running instance is allowed to complete.

When a program is disabled, its status changes to disabled. After you disable a program, the jobs pointing to the program cannot run even if the metadata of the program exists. If you set `force` to `FALSE`, the program must be referenced by no job while being dropped. Otherwise, an error occurs. If you set the `force` parameter to `TRUE`, the jobs pointing to the program are not disabled. However, these jobs fail at runtime because the program becomes invalid. The running jobs pointing to this program are not affected by the `DISABLE` operation and can continue running. If a program is disabled, parameters related to the program are not affected.

## Examples

```sql
BEGIN
  SYS.DBMS_SCHEDULER.DISABLE(
            job_name => 'empprogram',
            force => TRUE,
            COMMIT_SEMANTICS => 'STOP_ON_FIRST_ERROR');
END;
```
