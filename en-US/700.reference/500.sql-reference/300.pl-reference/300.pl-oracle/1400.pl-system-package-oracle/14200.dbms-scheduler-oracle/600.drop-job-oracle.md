# DROP_JOB

The `DROP_JOB` procedure drops one or more jobs or all jobs in one or more job classes. When you drop a job, all parameters configured for the job are also dropped.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_SCHEDULER.DROP_JOB (
job_name                IN VARCHAR2,
force                   IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
defer                   IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
commit_semantics        IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT 'null');
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|------------------|-----------------|
| job_name | The name of the job or job class. You can specify a list of names and separate them with commas (,). If you specify a job class, you must also specify the `SYS` schema.  If you specify the name of a job class, the jobs that belong to the job class are dropped, but the job class itself is not dropped.  |
| force | If you set this parameter to `TRUE`, the Scheduler first tries to stop running job instances and then drops the jobs.  |
| defer | If you set this parameter to `TRUE`, the Scheduler drops the specified jobs after the running jobs are completed.  |
| commit_semantics | The commit semantics. The following types are supported: <ul><li> `STOP_ON_FIRST_ERROR`: The procedure returns the message of the first error it encounters, and commits previous successful drop operations to disk. This is the default setting. </li>   <li> `TRANSACTIONAL`: The procedure returns the message of the first error it encounters, and rolls back all results before the error. If you set the `force` parameter to `TRUE`, this type is not supported. </li>    <li> `ABSORB_ERRORS`: The procedure ignores all errors and disables the rest of the jobs. It commits all successful disable operations. This type is supported only when a job or a list of jobs is to be disabled. </li> </ul> |



## Considerations

If the `force` and `defer` parameters are set to `FALSE` and you call the `DROP_JOB` procedure to drop a job that is running, the execution fails. Depending on the setting of the `commit_semantics` parameter, the entire call to the `DROP_JOB` procedure may fail.

If the `force` and `defer` parameters are set to `TRUE`, an error is returned.

## Examples

```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.DROP_JOB(job_name => 'job_test');
END;
```
