PARSE
==========================

The `PARSE` stored procedure parses a DML statement (including `SELECT`). It also executes other statements such as DDL statements or system commands.

The following versions of `PARSE` subprograms are available:

* One version supports `VARCHAR2` arguments.



* Another version supports `VARCHAR2A` or `VARCHAR2S` arguments. For example, the PARSE stored procedure may concatenate segmented strings from an array to form an SQL statement and parse the result.

Syntax
-----------------------

```sql
DBMS_SQL.PARSE(cursor_id       IN INTEGER,
sql_stmt      IN VARCHAR2,
language_flag   IN INTEGER);
```



```sql
DBMS_SQL.PARSE(cursor_id       IN INTEGER,
sql_stmt      IN VARCHAR2A,
lb            IN INTEGER,
ub            IN INTEGER,
lfflg         IN BOOLEAN,
language_flag   IN INTEGER);
```



```sql
DBMS_SQL.PARSE(cursor_id       IN INTEGER,
sql_stmt      IN VARCHAR2s,
lb            IN INTEGER,
ub            IN INTEGER,
lfflg         IN BOOLEAN,
language_flag   IN INTEGER);
```



Parameters
-------------------------



| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| cursor_id | The ID of the cursor used to parse the statement or array.  |
| sql_stmt | The SQL statement or array to parse.  |
| lb | The lower bound of the array index.  |
| ub | The upper bound of the array index.  |
| lfflg | If this parameter is set to `TRUE`, a line break is inserted after every element on concatenation.  |
| language_flag | Specifies the behavior for the SQL statement.  |



Considerations
-------------------------

* Using `DBMS_SQL` to dynamically run DDL statements can cause the program to be unresponsive. For example, calling a subprogram in a package may cause the package to be locked until the execution returns to the user side. Any operation that causes a conflicting lock, such as attempting to drop the package before the first lock is released, will stop the program from running.



* Code on the client side cannot reference the variables or constants in a remote package. Therefore, you must explicitly use the value of the constants. For example, the following code cannot be compiled on the client:


  ```sql
  DBMS_SQL.PARSE(cur_hdl,stmt_str,DBMS_SQL.NATIVE);
  -- This code uses the DBMS_SQL.NATIVE constant.
  ```



  The following code works on the client, because the argument is explicitly provided:

  ```sql
  DBMS_SQL.PARSE(cur_hdl,stmt_str,1);
  -- This code compiles on the client.
  ```



Exceptions
-------------------------

If you create a type, procedure, function, or package by using `DBMS_SQL` that has compilation warnings, the PL unit will be created, but an exception is raised.
