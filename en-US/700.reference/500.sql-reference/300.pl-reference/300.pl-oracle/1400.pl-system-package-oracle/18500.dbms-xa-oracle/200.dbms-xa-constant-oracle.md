## DBMS_XA constants for the flag field in XA_START and XA_END

The following table lists the DBMS_XA constants for the flag parameter of the XA_START function and the XA_END function.


| **Name** | **Type** | **Value** | **Description** |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| TMNOFLAGS | PLS_INTEGER | 00000000 | This option Indicates no flag value is chosen.  |
| TMSUCCESS | PLS_INTEGER | UTL_RAW.CAST_TO_BINARY_INTEGER ('04000000') | This option dissociates a caller from a transaction branch.  |
| TMJOIN | PLS_INTEGER | UTL_RAW.CAST_TO_BINARY_INTEGER ('00200000') | This option indicates the caller is joining the existing transaction branch.  |
| TMSUSPEND | PLS_INTEGER | UTL_RAW.CAST_TO_BINARY_INTEGER ('02000000') | This option indicates the caller is suspending without ending the association.  |
| TMRESUME | PLS_INTEGER | UTL_RAW.CAST_TO_BINARY_INTEGER ('08000000') | The option indicates the caller is resuming the association with a suspended transaction branch.  |

| XA_RBEND | PLS_INTEGER | XA_RBTRANSIENT | The inclusive upper bound of the rollback code. |
| XA_NOMIGRATE | PLS_INTEGER | 9 | The transaction branch may already be complete. |
| XA_HEURHAZ | PLS_INTEGER | 8 | The transaction branch may already be complete. |
| XA_HEURCOM | PLS_INTEGER | 7 | The transaction branch may already be committed. |
| XA_HEURRB | PLS_INTEGER | 6 | The transaction branch may already be rolled back. |
| XA_HEURMIX | PLS_INTEGER | 5 | Some transaction branches may already be committed, and others may be rolled back. |
| XA_RETRY | PLS_INTEGER | 4 | The routine returned with no effect and may be re-issued. |
