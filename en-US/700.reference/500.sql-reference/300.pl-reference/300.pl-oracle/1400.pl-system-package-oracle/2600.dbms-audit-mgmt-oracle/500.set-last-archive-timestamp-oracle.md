# SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP

The `SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP` procedure sets the timestamp that indicates when audit records were last archived. The audit administrator provides the timestamp to be attached to the audit records. The `CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL` procedure decides on the audit records to be deleted based on this timestamp.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP(
audit_trail_type         IN PLS_INTEGER,
last_archive_time        IN TIMESTAMP,
rac_instance_number      IN PLS_INTEGER DEFAULT NULL);
```



## Parameters



| Parameter | Description |
|---------------------|------------------|
| audit_trail_type | The audit trail type of the purge job. For more information about audit trail types, see [Audit trail types](../2600.dbms-audit-mgmt-oracle/100.dbms-audit-mgmt-overview-oracle.md).  |
| last_archive_time | The timestamp for determining the audit records or files to be deleted. This value indicates the last time when audit records or files are archived.  |
| rac_instance_number | The instance number. Default value: `NULL`. The `rac_instance_number` parameter is invalid when `audit_trail_type` is set to any of the following values: <ul><li> `audit_trail_all`    </li><li> `audit_trail_aud_std`    </li><li> `audit_trail_db_std`  </li></ul>  For a single-instance database, set `rac_instance_number` to 1.  |



## Considerations

When the audit trail type is `AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD`, the value of `last_archive_time` must be Universal Time Coordinated (UTC). This is because audit trail timestamps are stored in UTC format in the database. UTC is also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

When the audit trail type is `AUDIT_TRAIL_OS`, the value of `last_archive_time` must be the time in the local time zone. The time zone must be the one to which the server where the OS audit files are created belongs. This is because OS audit files are purged based on their last modification timestamps. The last modification timestamp is stored in the local time zone of the server.

## Examples

The following example calls the `SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP` procedure to set the last archive timestamp for the OS audit trail records on a database instance, and uses the `TO_TIMESTAMP` function to convert the string into a timestamp.

Then, it calls the `CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL` procedure and sets `use_last_arch_timestamp` to `TRUE` to delete all OS audit files that were modified before 11:11:11.11 November 11, 2021 from the current directory.

```sql
BEGIN
   DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP(
      audit_trail_type     => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_OS,
      last_archive_time    => TO_TIMESTAMP ('2021-11-11 11:11:11.11', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF')
      rac_instance_number  => 1);
END;
```
