# Overview

The `UTL_ENCODE` system package is used to encode `RAW` data into a standard format so that the data can be transferred between hosts.

You can use `UTL_ENCODE` functions to encode the body of emails. The system package also provides decode functions that correspond to the encode functions. These functions comply with the encoding standards that have been published for compatibility with third-party applications on the sending or receiving ends.
