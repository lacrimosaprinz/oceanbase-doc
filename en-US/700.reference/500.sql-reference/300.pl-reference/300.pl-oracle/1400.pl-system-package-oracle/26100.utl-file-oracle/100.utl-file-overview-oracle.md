# Overview

The `UTL_FILE` system package allows PL programs to read and write OS text files. `UTL_FILE` provides a restricted version of the OS stream file I/O.


  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>

## Privileges

You must have the `EXECUTE` privilege on the `UTL_FILE` system package.


## Data structure

The `UTL_FILE` system package defines a `RECORD` type, namely `FILE_TYPE`.

The content of `FILE_TYPE` is private to the `UTL_FILE` system package and therefore cannot be referenced or modified.

### Syntax

```sql
TYPE file_type IS RECORD (
id                BINARY_INTEGER,
datatype          BINARY_INTEGER,
byte_mode         BOOLEAN);
```



### Parameters



| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| id | The ID of the internal file handle.  |
| datatype | The data type of the file, such as `CHAR`, `Nchar`, or another binary type.  |
| byte_mode | Specifies whether to open the file in the binary or text format.  |



Exceptions
----------------------------------



| Exception | Description |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| INVALID_PATH | The file location is invalid.  |
| INVALID_MODE | The `open_mode` parameter in the `FOPEN` function is invalid.  |
| INVALID_FILEHANDLE | The file handle is invalid.  |
| INVALID_OPERATION | The file operation is not supported.  |
| READ_ERROR | The read buffer is too small, or an OS error occurred during the reading process.  |
| WRITE_ERROR | An OS error occurred during the write process.  |
| INTERNAL_ERROR | An internal PL error occurred.  |
| FILE_OPEN | An error occurred because the file is open.  |
| INVALID_MAXLINESIZE | The `max_linesize` parameter in the `FOPEN` function is invalid. Value range: [1,32767].  |
| INVALID_FILENAME | The file name is invalid.  |
| ACCESS_DENIED | Access is denied due to insufficient privileges.  |
| INVALID_OFFSET | The possible causes are as follows:<ul><li> Both `ABSOLUTE_OFFSET` and `ABSOLUTE_OFFSET` are `NULL`.    </li><li> `ABSOLUTE_OFFSET` \< 0.    </li><li> When `ABSOLUTE_OFFSET` is `NULL`, the value of `RELATIVE_OFFSET` exceeds the file length. </li></ul> |



## Subprograms

The following table describes the `UTL_FILE` subprograms supported by the current OceanBase Database version.


| Subprogram | Description |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [FCLOSE](../26100.utl-file-oracle/200.fclose-oracle.md) | Closes a file.  |
| [FFLUSH](../26100.utl-file-oracle/300.fflush-oracle.md) | Flushes data in the buffer to a file.  |
| [FOPEN](../26100.utl-file-oracle/400.fopen-oracle.md) | Opens a file based on user-specified information.  |
| [FGETPOS](../26100.utl-file-oracle/500.fgetpos-oracle.md) | Obtains the currently accessed position (offset in bytes) in a file.  |
| [FREMOVE](../26100.utl-file-oracle/600.fremove-oracle.md) | Deletes a file from the disk. (You must have the required delete privilege.) It is similar to the `rm` command in UNIX.  |
| [FRENAME](../26100.utl-file-oracle/700.frename-oracle.md) | Renames an existing file. It is similar to the `mv` command in UNIX.  |
| [FSEEK](../26100.utl-file-oracle/800.fseek-oracle.md) | Adjusts the accessed position forward or backward in a file by the specified number of bytes.  |
| [NEW_LINE](../26100.utl-file-oracle/900.new-line-utl-oracle.md) | Writes one or more OS-specified line terminators to a file.  |
| [GET_LINE](../26100.utl-file-oracle/1000.get-line-utl-oracle.md) | Reads a line of text.  |
| [PUT](../26100.utl-file-oracle/1100.put-utl-oracle.md) | Writes a string to a file.  |
| [PUT_LINE](../26100.utl-file-oracle/1200.put-line-utl-oracle.md) | Writes a line to a file and appends an OS-specified line terminator.  |
