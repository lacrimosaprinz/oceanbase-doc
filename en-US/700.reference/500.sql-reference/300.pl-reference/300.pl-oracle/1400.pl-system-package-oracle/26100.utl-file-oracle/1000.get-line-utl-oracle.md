# GET_LINE

The `GET_LINE` stored procedure reads data of a specified length starting from the offset position where the last read ends in the file based on the input file handle and read length. The read will not be stopped by a line break.

## Syntax

```sql
UTL_FILE.GET_LINE (
file           IN    FILE_TYPE,
buffer         OUT   VARCHAR2,
len            IN    PLS_INTEGER DEFAULT NULL);
```



## Parameters



| Parameter | Description |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| file | The handle of the file to read. The file must be opened at least in `r` mode.  |
| buffer | The output parameter used to store the data that is read from the file. The length of this string must be greater than the length specified by the `len` parameter.  |
| len | The number of data bytes to read. If this parameter is not specified, the procedure reads data based on the value of the `max_linesize` parameter specified when the file is opened.  |



## Exceptions

* `INVALID_FILEHANDLE`



* `INVALID_OPERATION`



* `NO_DATA_FOUND`



* `READ_ERROR`






## Considerations

* The file must be opened in `r` mode; otherwise, the `INVALID_OPERATION` exception is thrown.



* If the line cannot be stored in the buffer, the `READ_ERROR` exception is thrown. If no text is read because the file has ended, the `NO_DATA_FOUND` exception is thrown. If the file is opened in byte mode, the `INVALID_OPERATION` exception is thrown.



* Line terminators are not read to the buffer. Therefore, an empty string is returned when a blank line is read.



* If you do not specify the maximum size in `FOPEN`, the maximum size of the buffer parameter is 32,767 bytes. The default value is 1,024 bytes.
