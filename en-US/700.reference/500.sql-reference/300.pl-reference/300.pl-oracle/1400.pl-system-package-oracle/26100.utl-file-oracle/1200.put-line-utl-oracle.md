PUT_LINE
=============================

The `PUT_LINE` procedure writes a line followed by a line break of the specified size to a file.

`PUT_LINE` is basically the same as `PUT`, except that `PUT_LINE` puts a line break at the end of the line, and uses `autoflush` to automatically flush the line to the file system after each write operation.

Syntax
-----------------------

```sql
UTL_FILE.PUT_LINE (
file            IN  FILE_TYPE,
buffer          IN  VARCHAR2,
autoflush       IN  BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE);
```



Parameters
-------------------------



| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| file | The active file handle returned by an `FOPEN` call.  |
| buffer | The text buffer that stores the line to be written to the file.  |
| autoflush | Flushes data in the buffer to the disk if the value is `TRUE`.  |



Exceptions
-------------------------

* `INVALID_FILEHANDLE`



* `INVALID_OPERATION`



* `WRITE_ERROR`






Considerations
-------------------------

* If you do not specify the maximum size in `FOPEN`, the maximum size of the buffer parameter is 32,767 bytes. The default value is 1,024 bytes. The sum of all sequential `PUT` calls cannot exceed 32,767 without intermediate buffer flushes.



* If the file is opened in byte mode, the `INVALID OPERATION` exception will be raised.
