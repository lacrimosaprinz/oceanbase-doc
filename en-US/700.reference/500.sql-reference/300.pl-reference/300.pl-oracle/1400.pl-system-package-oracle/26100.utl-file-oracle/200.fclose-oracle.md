Syntax
-----------------------

```sql
UTL_FILE.FCLOSE (
file IN OUT FILE_TYPE);
```



Parameters
-------------------------



| Parameter | Description |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| file | The active file handle returned by the `FOPEN` or `FOPEN_NCHAR` stored procedure.  |



Considerations
-------------------------

If any buffered data has not been written to the file when you call the `FCLOSE` stored procedure, the system will attempt to write the buffered data to the file, but the `WRITE_ERROR` error may occur.

```sql
WRITE_ERROR
INVALID_FILEHANDLE
```
