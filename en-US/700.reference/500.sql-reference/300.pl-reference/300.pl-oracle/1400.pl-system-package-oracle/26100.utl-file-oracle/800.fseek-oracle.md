FSEEK
==========================

The `FSEEK` stored procedure adjusts the file pointer forward or backward within the file by the number of bytes specified.

Syntax
-----------------------

```sql
UTL_FILE.FSEEK (
file               IN   OUT  UTL_FILE.FILE_TYPE,
absolute_offset    IN   PL_INTEGER DEFAULT NULL,
relative_offset    IN   PLS_INTEGER DEFAULT NULL);
```



Parameters
-------------------------



| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| file | The target file handle.  |
| absolute_offset | The start position of the offset. Default value: `NULL`.  |
| relative_offset | The number of bytes to move. A positive integer indicates moving forward. A negative integer indicates moving backward.  |



Exceptions
-------------------------

* `INVALID_FILEHANDLE`



* `INVALID_OFFSET`



* `INVALID_OPERATION`



* `READ_ERROR`






Considerations
-------------------------

* You can use `FSEEK` to directly read the first few lines in the file without closing and reopening the file.



* If the beginning of the file is reached within bytes fewer than the number of bytes specified by `relative_offset`, the file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. If the end of the file is reached within bytes fewer than the specified number of bytes, the `INVALID_OFFSET` exception will be thrown.



* The file must be opened in `r` mode; otherwise, the `INVALID_OPERATION` exception will be thrown.
