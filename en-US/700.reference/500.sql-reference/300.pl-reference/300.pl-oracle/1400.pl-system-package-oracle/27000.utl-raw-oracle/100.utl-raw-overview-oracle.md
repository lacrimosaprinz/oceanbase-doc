# Overview

The `UTL_RAW` system package provides SQL functions that are used to manipulate `RAW` data types.

This package is essential because common SQL functions do not manipulate `RAW` data, while PL does not support overloading between `RAW` and `CHAR` data types.

The `UTL_RAW` package can also be used in other environments in addition to the database environment, and is therefore prefixed with `UTL` instead of `DBMS`.

    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>

## Considerations

`UTL_RAW` allows a `RAW` "record" to consist of many elements. By using the `RAW` data type, character set conversion will not be performed. This keeps the `RAW` in its original format when being transferred through remote procedure calls (RPCs).

## Subprograms

The following table describes the `UTL_RAW` subprograms supported by the current OceanBase Database version.


| **Subprogram** | **Description** |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| [BIT_AND](../27000.utl-raw-oracle/200.bit-and-oracle.md) | Performs the bitwise logical AND operation on values in `RAW r1` and `RAW r2` and returns the result RAW of the AND operation.  |
| [BIT_COMPLEMENT](../27000.utl-raw-oracle/300.bit-complement-oracle.md) | Performs the bitwise logical COMPLEMENT operation on values in `RAW r` and returns the result `RAW` of the COMPLEMENT operation.  |
| [BIT_OR](../27000.utl-raw-oracle/400.bit-or-oracle.md) | Performs the bitwise logical OR operation on values in `RAW r1` and `RAW r2` and returns the result RAW of the OR operation.  |
| [BIT_XOR](../27000.utl-raw-oracle/500.bit-xor-oracle.md) | Performs the bitwise logical XOR operation on values in `RAW r1` and `RAW r2` and returns the result RAW of the XOR operation.  |

| [COPIES](../27000.utl-raw-oracle/1600.compare-oracle.md) | Returns n concatenated copies of `r`.  |
| [COMPARE](../27000.utl-raw-oracle/1700.concat-utl-oracle.md) | Compares `RAW r1` and `RAW r2`.  |
| [CONCAT](../27000.utl-raw-oracle/1800.copies-oracle.md) | Concatenates a maximum of 12 `RAWs` into one `RAW`.  |
| [LENGTH](../27000.utl-raw-oracle/1900.length-utl-oracle.md) | Returns the length of `RAW r` in bytes.  |
