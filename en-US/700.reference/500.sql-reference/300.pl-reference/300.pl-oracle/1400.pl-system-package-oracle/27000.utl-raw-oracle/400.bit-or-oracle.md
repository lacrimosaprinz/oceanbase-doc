## Syntax

```sql
UTL_RAW.BIT_OR (
   r1 IN RAW,
   r2 IN RAW)
  RETURN RAW;
```

## Parameters


| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|--------|--------------------------|
| r1 | The `RAW` value for performing the OR operation with `r2`.  |
| r2 | The `RAW` value for performing the OR operation with `r1`.  |



## Return values

| **Value** | **Description** |
|---------|----------------------------|
| RAW | This value contains the result of the OR operation between `r1` and `r2`.  |




## Considerations

If `r1` and `r2` are different in length, the OR operation ends at the last byte of the shorter `RAW`, and appends the unprocessed part of the longer `RAW` to the partial result. The length of the result is equal to that of the longer input `RAW`.
