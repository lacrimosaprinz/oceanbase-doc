Overview
====================================

An `ANYDATA TYPE` contains an instance of a given type and the description of the type. `ANYDATA` is self-describing.
  
  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <ul>
    <li><code>ANYDATA</code> is currently supported only in PL, but cannot be used as a table column nor persistently stored in the database. </li>
    <li>Persistent storage of <code>ANYDATA</code> instances whose type contains embedded LOBs is currently not supported. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>

Construction
-------------------------

There are two ways to construct an `ANYDATA`:

* Construct an `ANYDATA` in its entirety through a single call to `CONVERT *`.

   ```sql
    STATIC FUNCTION ConvertNumber(num IN NUMBER) return AnyData,
    STATIC FUNCTION ConvertDate(dat IN DATE) return AnyData,
    STATIC FUNCTION ConvertChar(c IN CHAR) return AnyData,
    STATIC FUNCTION ConvertVarchar(c IN VARCHAR) return AnyData,
    STATIC FUNCTION ConvertVarchar2(c IN VARCHAR2) return AnyData,
    STATIC FUNCTION ConvertRaw(r IN RAW) return AnyData,
    STATIC FUNCTION ConvertBlob(b IN BLOB) return AnyData,
    STATIC FUNCTION ConvertClob(c IN CLOB) return AnyData,
    STATIC FUNCTION ConvertObject(obj IN "<ADT_1>") return AnyData,
    STATIC FUNCTION ConvertCollection(col IN "<COLLECTION_1>") return AnyData,
   /* Convert calls to Datetime and Nchar types. */
     STATIC FUNCTION ConvertTimestamp(ts IN TIMESTAMP_UNCONSTRAINED) return AnyData,
     STATIC FUNCTION ConvertTimestampTZ(ts IN TIMESTAMP_TZ_UNCONSTRAINED) return AnyData,
     STATIC FUNCTION ConvertTimestampLTZ(ts IN TIMESTAMP_LTZ_UNCONSTRAINED) return AnyData,
     STATIC FUNCTION ConvertIntervalYM(inv IN YMINTERVAL_UNCONSTRAINED) return AnyData,
     STATIC FUNCTION ConvertIntervalDS(inv IN DSINTERVAL_UNCONSTRAINED) return AnyData,
     STATIC FUNCTION ConvertNchar(nc IN NCHAR) return AnyData,
     STATIC FUNCTION ConvertNVarchar2(nc IN NVARCHAR2) return AnyData,
    /* Convert calls to BFloat, BDouble, and URowid types. */
     STATIC FUNCTION ConvertBFloat(fl IN BINARY_FLOAT) return AnyData,
     STATIC FUNCTION ConvertBDouble(dbl IN BINARY_DOUBLE) return AnyData,
     STATIC FUNCTION ConvertURowid(rid IN UROWID) return AnyData,
   ```




* Construct an `ANYDATA` by using a piece-by-piece approach.

   A call to the `BEGINCREATE` static procedure begins the construction process and a call to the `ENDCREATE` member procedure finishes the construction process. Between these two calls, you can use `SET*` calls to set the individual attributes of an object type or the elements of a collection. For piece-by-piece access to the attributes of objects and elements of a collection, the `PIECEWISE` member procedure should be called prior to `GET*` member functions.
     
     <main id="notice" type='notice'>
       <h4>Notice</h4>
       <p>The <code>ANYDATA</code> must be constructed or accessed sequentially starting from its first attribute (or collection element). The <code>BEGINCREATE</code> call automatically begins the construction in a piece-by-piece manner. <code>PIECEWISE</code> does not need to be called immediately after <code>BEGINCREATE</code> is called. <code>ENDCREATE</code> should be called to finish the construction process (before which any access calls can be made). </p>
     </main>





Access
-------------------------

Access functions are available based on SQL. These functions do not throw exceptions in case of type mismatch. Instead, if the type of the `ANYDATA` does not match the type of access, these functions return `NULL`. If you want to use only `ANYDATA` functions of the appropriate types returned in a query, you should use a `WHERE` clause that contains `GETTYPENAME` and select the type you are interested in, such as `SYS.NUMBER`. Each of these functions returns a value of the specified data type in a `SYS.ANYDATA` wrapper.

```sql
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessNumber(self IN AnyData) return NUMBER DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessDate(self IN AnyData) return DATE DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessChar(self IN AnyData) return CHAR DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessVarchar(self IN AnyData) return VARCHAR DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessVarchar2(self IN AnyData) return VARCHAR2 DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessRaw(self IN AnyData) return RAW DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessBlob(self IN AnyData) return BLOB DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessClob(self IN AnyData) return CLOB DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessTimestamp(self IN AnyData) return TIMESTAMP_UNCONSTRAINED DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessTimestampTZ(self IN AnyData) return TIMESTAMP_TZ_UNCONSTRAINED DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessTimestampLTZ(self IN AnyData) return TIMESTAMP_LTZ_UNCONSTRAINED DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessIntervalYM(self IN AnyData) return YMINTERVAL_UNCONSTRAINED DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessIntervalDS(self IN AnyData) return DSINTERVAL_UNCONSTRAINED DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessNchar(self IN AnyData) return NCHAR DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessNVarchar2(self IN AnyData) return NVARCHAR2 DETERMINISTIC,
  /* Access calls to Float, Double, and Rowid */
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessBFloat(self IN AnyData) return BINARY_FLOAT DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessBDouble(self IN AnyData) return BINARY_DOUBLE DETERMINISTIC,
  MEMBER FUNCTION AccessURowid(self IN AnyData) return UROWID DETERMINISTIC;
```



Subprograms
----------------------------------

The following table describes the `ANYDATA` subprograms supported by the current OceanBase Database version.


| Subprogram | Description |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| [BEGINCREATE static procedure](../27800.anydata-type-oracle/200.begincreate-static-stored-procedure-oracle.md) | Begins the process of creating an `ANYDATA`.  |
| [ENDCREATE member procedure](../27800.anydata-type-oracle/300.endcreate-stored-procedure-oracle.md) | Ends the process of creating an `ANYDATA`.  |
| [GET* member functions](../27800.anydata-type-oracle/400.get-member-stored-procedure-oracle.md) | Gets the current data value of the appropriate type.  |
| [GETTYPE member function](../27800.anydata-type-oracle/500.gettype-member-function-oracle.md) | Gets the type of the `ANYDATA`.  |
| [GETTYPENAME member function](../27800.anydata-type-oracle/600.get-oracle.md) | Gets the fully qualified type name for the `ANYDATA`.  |
| [PIECEWISE member procedure](../27800.anydata-type-oracle/700.gettypename-member-function-oracle.md) | Sets the mode of access to the current data value as an attribute at a time (if the data value is of `TYPECODE_OBJECT`). |
| [SET* member procedures](../27800.anydata-type-oracle/800.set-member-stored-procedure-oracle.md) | Sets the current data value.  |
