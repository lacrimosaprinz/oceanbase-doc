GET* member functions
===============================

`GET*` member functions get the current data value of a type matching the type of the call.

The type of the current data value depends on the current access mode of the `ANYDATA`. For example, whether `PIECEWICE` has been called.

If `PIECEWISE` has not been called, the `ANYDATA` is accessed in its entirety and the type of the data value should match the type of the `ANYDATA`.

If `PIECEWISE` has been called, the `ANYDATA` is accessed in a piece-wise manner. The type of the data value should match the type of the attribute (or collection element) at the current position.

Parameters
-------------------------



| Parameter | Description |
|------|---------------|
| self | An `ANYDATA`.  |
| num | The number to be obtained.  |



Return values
------------------------

The return value has different meanings in different access modes. In `PIECEWISE` (for a collection) mode, `DBMS_TYPES.NO_DATA` signifies the end of access to the collection.

Exceptions
-------------------------

* `DBMS_TYPES.TYPE_MISMATCH`: The expected type is different from the passed in type.



* `DBMS_TYPES.INVALID_PARAMETERS`: Invalid parameters. For example, it is inappropriate to add a number at this point during the creation process.



* `DBMS_TYPES.INCORRECT_USAGE`: Incorrect usage.
