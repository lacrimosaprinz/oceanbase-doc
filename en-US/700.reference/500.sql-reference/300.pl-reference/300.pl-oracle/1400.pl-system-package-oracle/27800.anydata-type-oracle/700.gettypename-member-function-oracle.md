PIECEWISE member procedure
=====================================

The `PIECEWISE` member procedure sets the mode of access to the current data value. If the `ANYDATA` is of the `TYPECODE_OBJECT` type, an attribute value of an `OBJECT` type is returned for each access after you use `PIECEWISE` to set the access mode.

For collection elements, an element in the collection is returned for each access after you set the access mode. Once this call has been made, subsequent calls to `SET*` and `GET*` will sequentially obtain individual attributes or collection elements.

Piece-wise construction of and access to nested attributes that are of `OBJECT` or `COLLECTION` types are not supported.
