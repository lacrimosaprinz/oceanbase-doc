`DBMS_CRYPTO` supports the encryption and hash algorithms of multiple industry standards, including the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES is approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to replace the Data Encryption Standard (DES).

The `DBMS_CRYPTO` package allows you to encrypt and decrypt common data types, including RAW and large objects (LOBs), such as images and audio. In addition, `DBMS_CRYPTO` provides globalization support to enable data encryption and decryption between databases that use different character sets.

Data types
-------------------------

The following table describes the data types used by `DBMS_CRYPTO` subprograms.


| **Data type** | **Description** |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| BLOB | The source or destination binary `LOB`.  |
| CLOB | The source or destination character `LOB`.  |
| PLS_INTEGER | The type of the encryption algorithm. This type is used with BLOB, CLOB, and RAW data types.  |
| RAW | The source or target destination buffer.  |



Algorithms
-----------------------

The `DBMS_CRYPTO` package contains predefined encryption algorithms, block cipher chaining algorithms, and block cipher padding algorithms.

* The following table describes the supported hash algorithms.



   | Name | Description |
   |------------|----------------------------|
   | HASH_MD4 | Generates a 128-bit hash or message digest of the input message.  |
   | HASH_MD5 | Generates a 128-digit hash. MD5 is more complex than MD4.  |
   | HASH_SH1 | Generates a 160-bit hash. It is a Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) function.  |
   | HASH_SH256 | Generates a 256-bit hash. It is a SHA-2 function.  |
   | HASH_SH384 | Generates a 384-bit hash. It is a SHA-2 function.  |
   | HASH_SH512 | Generates a 512-bit hash. It is a SHA-2 function.  |


* The following table describes the supported encryption algorithms.



   | **Name** | **Description** |
   |-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
   | ENCRYPT_AES128 | An advanced encryption standard and a block cipher. It uses 128-bit keys.  |
   | ENCRYPT_AES192 | An advanced encryption standard and a block cipher. It uses 192-bit keys.  |
   | ENCRYPT_AES256 | An advanced encryption standard and a block cipher. It uses 256-bit keys.  |
   | ENCRYPT_DES | A data encryption standard and a block cipher. It uses 56-bit keys.  |
   | ENCRYPT_3DES_2KEY | A data encryption standard and a block cipher. It encrypts the same block three times by using two keys. A valid key is 112 bits long.  |
   | ENCRYPT_3DES | A data encryption standard and a block cipher. It encrypts the same block three times.  |



* The following table describes the supported block cipher chaining algorithms.



   | **Name** | **Description** |
   |-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | CHAIN_ECB | The Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode. It divides plain text data into blocks of identical length and encrypts each block.  |
   | CHAIN_CBC | The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. It divides plain text data into blocks, performs XOR operation on each block with an initial block or its previous ciphertext block, and then encrypts the result.  |
   | CHAIN_CFB | The Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode. It encrypts data units smaller than blocks.  |
   | CHAIN_OFB | The Output Feedback (OFB) mode. It supports running block ciphers as synchronous stream ciphers. It is similar to CFB and differs from the latter in that n bits of the previous output block are moved to the rightmost position of the queue of data to be encrypted.  |


* The following table describes the supported block cipher padding algorithms.

   | **Name** | **Description** |
   |-----------|-------------------------------------|
   | PAD_PKCS5 | Provides padding in compliance with PKCS #5, namely Password-Based Cryptography Standard.  |
   | PAD_NONE | Allows you to specify no padding algorithm. The caller must ensure that the block size is correct. Otherwise, the package will return an error.  |


Limitations
-------------------------

`DBMS_CRYPTO` does not directly support data of the VARCHAR2 type. To encrypt data of the VARCHAR2 type, you must first convert the data to the uniform database character set AL32UTF8, and then to the RAW data type. You can use `DBMS_CRYPTO` to encrypt data after these conversions.

Subprograms
--------------------------

The following table describes the `DBMS_CRYPTO` subprograms supported by the current OceanBase Database version.


| **Subprogram** | **Description** |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [ENCRYPT](../3800.dbms-crypto-oracle/200.encrypt-oracle.md) | Encrypts `RAW` data by using a stream or block cipher with a user-provided key and an optional initialization vector (IV).  |
| [DECRYPT](../3800.dbms-crypto-oracle/300.decrypt-oracle.md) | Decrypts `RAW` data by using a stream or block cipher with a user-provided key and an optional IV.  |
| [HASH](../3800.dbms-crypto-oracle/400.hash-oracle.md) | Applies a supported encryption or hash algorithm such as MD4, MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-2 to data.  |
