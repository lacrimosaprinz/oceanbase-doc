  </main>

The ID of the newly registered debugging session.

Considerations
-------------


* The `CREATE ANY PROCEDURE` privilege does not affect the visibility of routines through the debugger. A `DEBUG` privilege with a corresponding `DEBUG ANY PROCEDURE` variant is introduced for each object. These are required if you want to see routines of users other than the session's logon user.

* The checks that the debugger makes after this call to look for the DEBUG privilege on individual procedures are performed in the context of the session's logon user, the roles that were enabled on the session level when the call was made, even if those roles were unavailable within a definer's rights environment of the call, and the debug role.
