SET_TIMEOUT_BEHAVIOUR
==========================================

The `SET_TIMEOUT_BEHAVIOUR` stored procedure tells Probe how to handle the target session when a timeout occurs.

This call is made in the target session.

Syntax
-----------

```sql
DBMS_DEBUG.SET_TIMEOUT_BEHAVIOUR (
behaviour IN PLS_INTEGER);
```



Parameters
-------------

The `behaviour` parameter can be one of the following:


| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| retry_on_timeout | Retry. Timeout has no effect. It is similar to setting the timeout to an infinitely large value.  |
| continue_on_timeout | Continue execution and use the same event flags.  |
| nodebug_on_timeout | Turn off the debug mode by calling `DEBUG_OFF` and continue execution. The target session stops generating events unless it is reinitialized by calling `DEBUG_ON`.  |
| abort_on_timeout | Continue execution with the `abort_execution` flag, which will cause the program to stop immediately. The session remains in debug mode.  |



Exceptions
-------------

`unimplemented` indicates that the requested behavior is not recognized.

Considerations
-------------

If this procedure is not called, the default behavior is `continue_on_timeout`, because it allows the debugging client to regain control at the next event and does not cause the target session to hang indefinitely.
