Overview
=====================================
The `DBMS_DESCRIBE` package queries information related to PL objects.

`DBMS_DESCRIBE` returns a group of index tables containing results based on the specified object names. The package performs full-name conversion and security checks for the final objects.

The `DBMS_DESCRIBE` package has the same call features as `OCIDescribeAny`.

Privileges

TYPE NUMBER_TABLE IS TABLE OF NUMBER
    INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
```
