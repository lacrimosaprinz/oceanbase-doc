# BROKEN

The `BROKEN` stored procedure sets the state of a job to broken or not broken. A job in the broken state will not be scheduled.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_JOB.BROKEN (
job            IN  BINARY_INTEGER,
broken      IN  BOOLEAN,
next_date  IN  DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE);
```



## Parameters



| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| job | The unique ID of the job to be modified. You can query this ID from the `JOB` column of the `USER_JOBS` or `DBA_JOBS` view.  |
| broken | Sets the job as broken or not broken. `TRUE` indicates that the job is set as broken, and `FALSE` indicates that the job is set as not broken.  |
| next_date | The next date for running the job.  |



## Considerations

* Before a job is submitted, it cannot be handled by the job queue in the background.



* If a job has failed 16 consecutive times, it is automatically set as broken and stops running.
