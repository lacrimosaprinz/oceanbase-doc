Syntax
-----------------------

```sql
DBMS_JOB.INTERVAL (
job         IN  BINARY_INTEGER,
interval  IN  VARCHAR2);
```



Parameters
-------------------------



| Parameter | Description |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| job | The unique ID of the job to be modified. You can query this ID from the `JOB` column of the `USER_JOBS` or `DBA_JOBS` view.  |
| interval | The interval at which the job runs.  |



Considerations
-------------------------

* If the stored procedure is executed, the `interval` field of the job is updated. The next running date of the job is calculated by using the `SELECT INTERVAL INTO NEXT_DATE FROM DUAL` statement.



* The value of the interval field must be a time in the future. The following table describes the valid values of the interval field.



   | Interval | Description |
   |---------------------------------|----------|
   | 'sysdate + 7' | The job runs once every week.  |
   | 'next_day(sysdate,''TUESDAY'')' | The job runs once every Tuesday.  |
   | 'null' | The job runs only once.  |





* If the value of `interval` is `null` and the job is completed, this job will be automatically deleted from the job queue.



* Before a job is submitted, it cannot be handled by the job queue in the background.
