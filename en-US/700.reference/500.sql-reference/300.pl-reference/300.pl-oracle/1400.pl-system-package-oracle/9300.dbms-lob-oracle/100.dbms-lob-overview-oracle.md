# Overview

The `DBMS_LOB` package reads and modifies binary large objects (`BLOBs`) and character large objects (`CLOBs`). It provides most of the large object (`LOB`) operations.

    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>

Privileges
----------------------

This package must be created under the `SYS` user. However, the operations that the package provides are performed by the current caller, instead of the `SYS` user.

`DBMS_LOB` subprograms called from an anonymous procedural language (PL) block are executed with privileges of the current user, whereas `DBMS_LOB` subprograms called from a stored procedure are executed with privileges of the owner of the stored procedure.

When you create a subprogram, you can set the `AUTHID` parameter to specify whether the authorization of the subprogram definer or the caller is required. Here is an example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE proc1 AUTHID DEFINER ...
```



or

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE proc1 AUTHID CURRENT_USER ...
```



Data types
-------------------------



| **Data type** | **Description** |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| BLOB | The source or destination binary `LOB`.  |
| RAW | The source or destination `RAW` buffer. It is used together with `BLOB`.  |
| CLOB | The source or destination character `LOB`.  |
| VARCHAR2 | The source or destination character buffer. It is used together with `CLOB`.  |
| INTEGER | The size of a buffer or `LOB`, the offset into a `LOB`, or the amount of data to access.  |



Considerations
----------------------

All `DBMS_LOB` subprograms rely on the `LOB` locator to work. For the successful execution of `DBMS_LOB` subprograms, you must pass a locator that identifies a `LOB` that already exists in the database tablespace or external file system.

All `DBMS_LOB` APIs support operations on remote `LOB` locators. All APIs that take in two locators must have both `LOBs` collocated in the same database.

Subprograms
-----------------------

The following table describes the `DBMS_LOB` subprograms supported by the current OceanBase Database version.


| **Subprogram** | **Description** |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| [APPEND](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/200.append-oracle.md) | Appends the content of a source `LOB` to a destination `LOB`.  |
| [CLOSE](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/300.close-oracle.md) | Closes an internal or external `LOB` that was previously opened.  |
| [COPY](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/500.copy-oracle.md) | Copies all or part of a source internal `LOB` to a destination internal `LOB`.  |
| [CREATETEMPORARY](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/600.createtemporary-oracle.md) | Creates a temporary `BLOB` or `CLOB` and a corresponding index in the default temporary tablespace.  |
| [ERASE](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/700.eraese-oracle.md) | Erases all or some `LOBs`.  |
| [FREETEMPORARY](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/800.freetemporary-oracle.md) | Releases temporary `BLOBs` or `CLOBs` in the default temporary tablespace.  |
| [GETLENGTH](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/900.getlength-oracle.md) | Obtains the length of a `LOB`.  |
| [ISOPEN](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/1000.isopen-oracle.md) | Checks whether a `LOB` is already opened by an input locator.  |
| [INSTR](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/1100.instr-oracle.md) | Returns the matching position of the `nth` occurrence of a pattern in a `LOB`.  |
| [ISTEMPORARY](1150.istemporary-of-oracle-mode.md) | Checks whether the locater points to a temporary `LOB`.  |
| [OPEN](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/1200.open-oracle.md) | Opens an internal, external, or temporary `LOB` in a specified mode.  |
| [READ](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/1300.read-oracle.md) | Reads data from a `LOB` starting from the specified offset.  |
| [SUBSTR](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/1400.substr-oracle.md) | Returns part of a `LOB` starting from the specified offset.  |
| [TRIM](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/1500.trim-oracle.md) | Trims a `LOB` to the specified length.  |
| [WRITE](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/1600.write-oracle.md) | Writes data to a `LOB` starting from the specified offset.  |
| [WRITEAPPEND](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/1700.writeappend-oracle.md) | Appends a buffer to the end of a `LOB`.  |
