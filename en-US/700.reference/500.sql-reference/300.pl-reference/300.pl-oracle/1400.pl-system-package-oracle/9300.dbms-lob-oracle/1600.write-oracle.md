WRITE
==========================

The `WRITE` stored procedure writes a specified amount of data into an internal `LOB`, starting from an absolute offset position from the beginning of the `LOB`.


The data to be written comes from the `buffer` parameter. `WRITE` replaces (overwrites) any data that already exists in the `LOB` at the offset based on the length you specify.

Syntax
-----------

```sql
DBMS_LOB.WRITE (
lob_loc  IN OUT  NOCOPY BLOB,
amount   IN             INTEGER,
offset   IN             INTEGER,
buffer   IN             RAW);

DBMS_LOB.WRITE (
lob_loc  IN OUT  NOCOPY CLOB CHARACTER SET ANY_CS,
amount   IN             INTEGER,
offset   IN             INTEGER,
buffer   IN             VARCHAR2 CHARACTER SET ANY_CS);
```



Parameters
-------------



| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| lob_loc | The locator for the internal `LOB` that the data is written to. For more information, see [Considerations](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/100.dbms-lob-overview-oracle.md).  |
| amount | The amount of data to write. The value is in bytes for `BLOBs`, and in characters for `CLOBs`.  |
| offset | The offset from the beginning of the `LOB`, with 1 as the origin, for the read operation. The value is in bytes for `BLOBs` and in characters for `CLOBs`.  |
| buffer | The buffer for the write operation.  |



Exceptions
-------------



| **Exception** | **Description** |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VALUE_ERROR | Any of the `lob_loc`, `amount`, and `offset` parameters is `NULL`, invalid, or out of range.  |
| INVALID_ARGVAL | Several possibilities: <ul><li> The value of the `amount` parameter is less than 1.   </li><li> The value of the `amount` parameter is greater than 32,767 bytes or its equivalent in characters.   </li><li> The value of the `offset` parameter is less than 1.   </li><li> The value of the `offset` parameter is greater than the value of `LOBMAXSIZE`.  </li></ul> |
| QUERY_WRITE | Cannot perform a `LOB` write inside a query or PDML parallel execution server.  |
| BUFFERING_ENABLED | The operation cannot be performed because `LOB` buffering is enabled.  |
| SECUREFILE_OUTOFBOUNDS | A write operation past the end of a `LOB` having `FRAGMENT_*` was attempted.  |



Considerations
-------------

* If the amount specified is larger than the size of data in the buffer, an exception will be thrown. If the amount specified is smaller than the size of data in the buffer, only the data in the buffer will be written to the `LOB`. If the offset you specify is beyond the end of the data in the `LOB`, zero-byte fillers will be inserted into the `BLOB`, and spaces will be inserted into the `CLOB`.



* The form of the `VARCHAR2` buffer must match the form of the `CLOB` parameter. That is, if the type of the input `LOB` parameter is `CLOB`, the data in the buffer must be of the `CHAR` type.



* When you call `DBMS_LOB.WRITE` from the client, data in the buffer must use the client's character set. Before the data is written from the buffer to the `LOB`, the database converts the character set of the client's buffer to the character set of the server.



* You can choose not to wrap the `LOB` operation inside the Open/Close API. If you did not open the `LOB` before the operation, the functional and domain indexes on the `LOB` column are updated during the call. However, if you opened the `LOB` before the operation, you must close it before you commit the transaction. When an internal `LOB` is closed, the functional and domain indexes on the `LOB` column are updated.



* If you do not wrap the `LOB` operation in the Open/Close API, the functional and domain indexes are updated each time you write to the `LOB`. To avoid adversely affecting performance, we recommend that you wrap write operations on the `LOB` in the `OPEN` or `CLOSE` statement.



* When necessary, `WRITE` obtains the `LOB` before writing data to it, unless the write operation is specified to overwrite the entire `LOB`.
