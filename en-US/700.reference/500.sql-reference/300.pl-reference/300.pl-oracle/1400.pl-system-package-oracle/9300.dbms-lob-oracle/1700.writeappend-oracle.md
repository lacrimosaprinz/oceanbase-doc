# WRITEAPPEND

The `WRITEAPPEND` stored procedure appends a specified amount of data to the end of a specified internal `LOB`. The data to be written comes from the `buffer` parameter.

  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>
  </main>

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_LOB.WRITEAPPEND (
lob_loc IN OUT NOCOPY BLOB,
amount  IN            INTEGER,
buffer  IN            RAW);

DBMS_LOB.WRITEAPPEND (
lob_loc IN OUT NOCOPY CLOB CHARACTER SET ANY_CS,
amount  IN            INTEGER,
buffer  IN            VARCHAR2 CHARACTER SET ANY_CS);
```



## Parameters



| Parameter | Description |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| lob_loc | The locator of the internal `LOB` to write to. For more information, see [Considerations](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/100.dbms-lob-overview-oracle.md).  |
| amount | The amount of data to write. The value is in bytes for `BLOBs`, and in characters for `CLOBs`.  |
| buffer | The buffer for the write operation.  |


  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If the amount specified is larger than the size of data in the buffer, an exception will be thrown. If the amount specified is smaller than the size of data in the buffer, only the data in the buffer will be appended to the <code>LOB</code>. </p>
  </main>

## Exceptions



| Exception | Description |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VALUE_ERROR | Any of the `lob_loc`, `amount`, and `offset` parameters is `NULL`, invalid, or out of range.  |
| INVALID_ARGVAL | Several possibilities: <ul><li> The value of the `amount` parameter is less than 1.   </li><li> The value of the `amount` parameter is greater than 32,767 bytes or its equivalent in characters.</li></ul> |
| QUERY_WRITE | Cannot perform a `LOB` write inside a query or PDML parallel execution server.  |
| BUFFERING_ENABLED | The operation cannot be performed because `LOB` buffering is enabled.  |



## Considerations

* The form of the `VARCHAR` buffer must match the form of the `CLOB` parameter. If the type of the input `LOB` parameter is `CLOB`, the data in the buffer must be of the `CHAR` type.



* When you call `DBMS_LOB.WRITEAPPEND` from the client, such as in a `BEGIN` or `END` block in OBClient, data in the buffer must use the client's character set. Before the data is written from the buffer to the `LOB`, the database converts the character set of the client's buffer to the character set of the server.



* You can choose not to wrap the `LOB` operation inside the Open/Close API. If you did not open the `LOB` before the operation, the functional and domain indexes on the `LOB` column are updated during the call. However, if you opened the `LOB` before the operation, you must close it before you commit the transaction. When an internal `LOB` is closed, the functional and domain indexes on the `LOB` column are updated.



* If you do not wrap the `LOB` operation in the Open/Close API, the functional and domain indexes are updated each time you write to the `LOB`. This may adversely affect performance. Therefore, we recommend that you wrap write operations on the `LOB` in the `OPEN` or `CLOSE` statement.



* When necessary, `WRITEAPPEND` obtains the `LOB` before it appends data to it.
