# APPEND

The `APPEND` stored procedure appends the content of a source internal `LOB` to a target `LOB`.

  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_LOB. APPEND (
dest_lob IN OUT  NOCOPY BLOB,
src_lob  IN             BLOB);

DBMS_LOB.APPEND (
dest_lob  IN OUT NOCOPY CLOB CHARACTER SET ANY_CS,
src_lob   IN            CLOB CHARACTER SET ANY_CS);
```



## Parameters



| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----------|----------------------|
| dest_lob | The locator of the internal `LOB` to which you want to append data.  |
| src_lob | The locator of the internal `LOB` from which data is read.  |



## Exceptions



| **Exception** | **Description** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| VALUE_ERROR | The source `LOB` or target `LOB` is `NULL`.  |
| QUERY_WRITE | Cannot perform a `LOB` write inside a query or PDML parallel execution server.  |
| BUFFERING_ENABLED | The operation cannot be performed because `LOB` buffering is enabled.  |



## Considerations

* You can choose not to wrap the `LOB` operation inside the Open/Close API. If you did not open the `LOB` before the operation, the functional and domain indexes on the `LOB` column are updated during the call. However, if you opened the `LOB` before the operation, you must close it before you commit the transaction. When an internal `LOB` is closed, the functional and domain indexes on the `LOB` column are updated.

   If you do not wrap the `LOB` operation in the Open/Close API, the functional and domain indexes are updated each time you write to the `LOB`. To avoid adversely affecting performance, we recommend that you wrap write operations on the `LOB` in the `OPEN` or `CLOSE` statement.


* If `APPEND` is called on an archived `LOB`, it implicitly obtains the `LOB` before the first byte is written.
