## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_LOB.CLOSE (
lob_loc    IN OUT NOCOPY BLOB);

DBMS_LOB.CLOSE (
lob_loc    IN OUT NOCOPY CLOB CHARACTER SET ANY_CS);
```



## Parameters



| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| lob_loc | The locator of the `LOB`. For more information, see [Considerations](../9300.dbms-lob-oracle/100.dbms-lob-overview-oracle.md).  |





## Considerations

* `CLOSE` requires a round trip to the server for both internal and external `LOBs`. For internal `LOBs`, `CLOSE` triggers other code that relies on the `CLOSE` call.



* You can choose not to wrap all `LOB` operations inside the Open/Close API. If you open a `LOB`, you must close it before you commit the transaction. An error is produced if you do not. When an internal `LOB` is closed, the functional and domain indexes on the `LOB` column are updated.



* If you commit a transaction before you close all the `LOBs` opened by the transaction, an error will be returned. When an error occurs, the openness of the open `LOBs` is discarded, but the transaction is committed. That is, all the changes made to the `LOB` and non-`LOB` data in the transaction are committed, but the domain-based and function-based indexes are not updated. If this happens, you must rebuild the functional and domain indexes on the `LOB` column.
