COPY
=========================

The `COPY` stored procedure copies all or part of a source internal `LOB` to a target internal `LOB`.

You can specify the offset for the source `LOB` and target `LOB` and the number of bytes or characters to be copied.

Syntax
-----------------------

```sql
DBMS_LOB.COPY (
dest_lob    IN OUT NOCOPY BLOB,
src_lob     IN            BLOB,
amount      IN            INTEGER,
dest_offset IN            INTEGER := 1,
src_offset  IN            INTEGER := 1);

DBMS_LOB.COPY (
dest_lob    IN OUT NOCOPY CLOB CHARACTER SET ANY_CS,
src_lob     IN            CLOB CHARACTER SET ANY_CS,
amount      IN            INTEGER,
dest_offset IN            INTEGER := 1,
src_offset  IN            INTEGER := 1);
```



Parameters
-------------------------



| Parameter | Description |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| dest_lob | The locator of the target `LOB`.  |
| src_lob | The locator of the source `LOB`.  |
| amount | The amount of data to be copied. The value is in bytes for `BLOBs` and in characters for `CLOBs`.  |
| dest_offset | The offset, with 1 as the origin, for the start of copy in the target `LOB`. The value is in bytes or characters.  |
| src_offset | The offset, with 1 as the origin, for the start of copy in the source `LOB`. The value is in bytes or characters.  |



Exceptions
-------------------------



| Exception | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| VALUE_ERROR | Any input parameters are `NULL` or invalid.  |
| INVALID_ARGVAL | Several possibilities: <ul><li>  The value of `src_offset` or `dest_offset` is smaller than 1.   </li><li> The value of the `src_offset` or `dest_offset` parameter is greater than the value of `LOBMAXSIZE`.   </li><li> The value of the `amount` parameter is less than 1.   </li><li> The value of the `amount` parameter is greater than the value of `LOBMAXSIZE`. </li></ul> |
| QUERY_WRITE | `LOB` write is not allowed in the query.  |
| BUFFERING_ENABLED | The operation cannot be performed because `LOB` buffering is enabled.  |



Considerations
-------------------------

* If the offset specified in the target `LOB` is beyond the end of the data in the `LOB`, the target `BLOB` will be filled with zero bytes, and the target `CLOB` will be filled with spaces. If the offset is less than the current length of the target `LOB`, the existing data will be overwritten.



* No error will occur if the specified amount exceeds the data length of the source `LOB`. Therefore, you can specify a large amount of data to be copied from the source `LOB`. This way, data starting from the offset position determined by `src_offset` to the end of the source `LOB` is copied.



* You can choose not to wrap the `LOB` operation inside the Open/Close API. If you did not open the `LOB` before the operation, the functional and domain indexes on the `LOB` column are updated during the call. However, if you opened the `LOB` before the operation, you must close it before you commit the transaction. When an internal `LOB` is closed, the functional and domain indexes on the `LOB` column are updated.

   If you do not wrap the `LOB` operation in the Open/Close API, the functional and domain indexes are updated each time you write to the `LOB`. To avoid adversely affecting performance, we recommend that you wrap write operations on the `LOB` in the `OPEN` or `CLOSE` statement.




* If the source and target `LOBs` are archived, the procedure retrieves them before copying data. In case of a complete overwrite, the procedure does not retrieve the target `LOB`.
