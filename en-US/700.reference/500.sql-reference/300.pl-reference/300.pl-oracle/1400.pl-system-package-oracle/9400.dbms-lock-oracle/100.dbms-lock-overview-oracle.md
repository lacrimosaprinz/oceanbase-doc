# Overview

The `DBMS_LOCK` package provides an interface to the lock management services of OceanBase Database.

The system package provides the following features:

* Exclusive access to a device, such as a terminal
* Perception of a lock release when an application releases or cleans up a lock
* Synchronization and coordination among different applications or processes

    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>

## Privileges

The database system may impose an upper limit on the maximum number of available locks. When you use locks or provide this package to other users, consider granting the `EXECUTE` privilege only to specific users or roles.

## Constants

The following table lists the constants used in the `DBMS_LOCK` package.

| Constant | Attribute | Type | Value | OEM abbreviation | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| NL_MODE | Nul1 | INTEGER | 1 | None | Lock-free mode |
| SS_MODE | Sub Shared | INTEGER | 2 | ULRS | Intention read lock |
| SX_MODE | Sub eXclusive/Row Exclusive Mode | INTEGER | 3 | ULRX | Intention write lock |
| S_MODE | Shared/Row Exclusive Mode/Intended Exclusive | INTEGER | 4 | ULRSX | Read lock |
| SSX_MODE | Shared Sub eXclusive/Share Row Exclusive Mode | INTEGER | 5 | None | Shared intention write lock |
| X_MODE | Exclusive | INTEGER | 6 | ULX | Write lock |

## Rules and limitations

The following table describes the lock compatibility matrix. `Y` indicates that the application succeeds, and `N` indicates that the application fails.

| **Lock held mode** | **GET NL** | **GET SS** | **GET SX** | **GET S** | **GET SSX** | **GET X** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NL | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| SS | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y | N |
| SX | Y | Y | Y | N | N | N |
| S | Y | Y | N | Y | N | N |
| SSX | Y | Y | N | N | N | N |
| X | Y | N | N | N | N | N |

Specify `maxwait` for a lock to set the default wait time.

```sql
maxwait  constant integer := 32767;
```

## Considerations

* User locks are identified with the prefix "UL" and will never conflict with table locks.
* Locks are automatically released when a session terminates.
* The lock ID ranges from 0 to 1073741823.
* A user lock acts in the same way as a table lock and has all the features of a table lock, such as deadlock detection.
* Make sure that any user locks used in distributed transactions are released upon transaction commits; otherwise, an undetected deadlock may occur.
* `DBMS_LOCK` is most efficient with a limit of a few hundred locks for each session.

## Subprograms

The following table describes the `DBMS_LOCK` subprograms supported by the current OceanBase Database version.

| **Subprogram** | **Description** |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| [ALLOCATE_UNIQUE](110.allocate-unique-of-oracle-mode.md) | Requests a unique lock ID in the range of 1073741824 to 1999999999 for a specified lock name.  |
| [ALLOCATE_UNIQUE_AUTONOMOUS](120.allocate-unique-autonomous-of-oracle-mode.md) | Requests a unique lock ID for a specified lock name.  |
| [REQUEST](150.request-of-oracle-mode.md) | Requests a lock.  |
| [SLEEP](../9400.dbms-lock-oracle/200.sleep-oracle.md) | Suspends the current session for a specific amount of time.  |
