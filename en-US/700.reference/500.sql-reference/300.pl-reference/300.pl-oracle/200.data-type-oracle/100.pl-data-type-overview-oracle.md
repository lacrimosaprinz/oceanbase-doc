Overview
=======================

Every constant, variable, parameter, and function return value in PL has a data type that defines its storage format, use limitations, valid value range, and valid operations.

In OceanBase Database, PL predefines a variety of data types and allows you to define custom data types.

PL predefined data types include:

* SQL data types



* BOOLEAN



* REF cursor



* User-defined types



* `PLS_INTEGER` and `BINARY_INEGER`

    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <ul>
    <li><code>BOOLEAN</code>, <code>RECORD</code>, <code>REF CURSOR</code>, and some predefined subtypes are specific to PL. </li>
    <li>You cannot use such PL-specific data types in standalone subprograms at the schema level. You need to put the subprogram into a package so as to use these data types. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>

In addition, OceanBase Database supports the following two JSON data types in PL statements: `JSON_OBJECT_T` and `JSON_ELEMENT_T`.
