# LOB data types


Large objects (LOBs) store large unstructured data such as literals, images, videos, and spatial data. LOB types are categorized into binary large objects (`BLOBs`) and character large objects (`CLOBs`).

BLOB
-------------------------

You can store large binary objects such as images and videos in a database as BLOBs and consider them as large bit streams without character set syntax.



CLOB
-------------------------

You can store single-byte and multi-byte character data as CLOBs. Fixed-width and variable-width character sets are supported and they both use the database character set.
