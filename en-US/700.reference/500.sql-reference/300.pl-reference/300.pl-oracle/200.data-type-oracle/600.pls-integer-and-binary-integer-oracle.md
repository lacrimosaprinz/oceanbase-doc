PLS_INTEGER and BINARY_INTEGER
=================================================

In OceanBase Database, the `PLS_INTEGER` and `BINARY_INTEGER` data types in PL are the same.

`PLS_INTEGER` stores signed integers that range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, which are represented by using 32 bits. Compared with `NUMBER`, `PLS_INTEGER` uses less space and achieves higher computing efficiency.

If the evaluation result of two values of the `PLS_INTEGER` type exceeds the value range of `PLS_INTEGER`, the database returns an error. If the data size exceeds the value range of `PLS_INTEGER`, use the built-in type `INTEGER` instead.

Even if a value is finally assigned to a variable of the `NUMBER` type, an error is still returned. Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> DECLARE
     num1 PLS_INTEGER := 2147483647;
     num2 PLS_INTEGER := 1;
     total NUMBER;
BEGIN
     total := num1 + num2;
     DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(total);
END;
/
ORA-01426: numeric overflow
```



To solve the issue, replace at least one variable with `INTEGER`. Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> DECLARE
     num1 PLS_INTEGER := 2147483647;
     num2 INTEGER := 1;
     total NUMBER;
BEGIN
     total := num1 + num2;
     DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(total);
END;
/
