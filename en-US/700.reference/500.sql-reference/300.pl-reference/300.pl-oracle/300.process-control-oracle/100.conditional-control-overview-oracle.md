OceanBase Database has the following three types of PL flow control statements:

* Conditional control

   A conditional control statement runs different statements based on different runtime conditions. Conditional selection statements include `IF` and `CASE`.


* Loop control

   A loop control statement repeatedly executes a series of statements based on conditions. Loop statements include `FOR LOOP`, `WHILE LOOP`, and basic `LOOP`.


* Sequential control

   A sequential control statement allows transfers to the specified statement or does nothing. Sequential control statements include `GOTO` and `NULL`.
