# Sequential control

A sequential control statement allows transfers to the specified statement or does nothing.

Compared with the `IF` and `LOOP` statements, the sequential control statements `GOTO` and `NULL` are less important to PL programming. PL seldom uses the `GOTO` statement to transfer to a specified statement. The `NULL` statement means no operation, and it is generally used to describe meanings and operations of conditional statements to improve readability.

GOTO statement
----------------------------

You can use the `GOTO` statement to unconditionally transfer to another position in the code block. You must predefine a label and then transfer to the label by using the `GOTO` statement.  The label must be placed before a statement, and cannot appear inside a statement.

Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> DECLARE
    cnt NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN
    WHILE cnt < 3 LOOP
       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (cnt);
       cnt :=  cnt + 1;
       GOTO JUMP_OUT;
    END LOOP;
     cnt := 0;
     <<JUMP_OUT>>
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (cnt);
END;
 /
Query OK, 0 rows affected

```



NULL statement
----------------------------

If you execute a `NULL` statement, no operation is executed. This statement is usually used as a placeholder. For example, you can use the `NULL` statement as placeholders in code debugging to avoid syntax errors.
