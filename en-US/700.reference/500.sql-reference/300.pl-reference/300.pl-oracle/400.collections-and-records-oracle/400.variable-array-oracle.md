# Varrays

A variable-size array (or varray) is a collection of ordered elements. All the elements have the same data type and the index of each element corresponds to the position of the element in the array.

The size of a varray is limited. When you create a varray, you must specify its maximum length.

The syntax for creating a varray is as follows:

```javascript
TYPE varray_name IS VARRAY( size ) OF element_type [ NOT NULL ] ;
```



`varray_name` specifies the name of the varray. The value of `size` is a positive integer indicating the maximum number of elements in the array. `element_type` specifies the data type of all elements in the array. By default, null values are allowed for elements unless a `NOT NULL` constraint is added.

**Example: Create a varray**

```javascript
obclient> DECLARE
  TYPE players IS VARRAY(5) OF VARCHAR2(20);   
  team PLAYERS := players('Andrew', 'Barton', 'Conrad', 'Dick','Edward');
  PROCEDURE print_team (heading VARCHAR2) IS
  BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(heading);
    FOR i IN 1..5 LOOP
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(i || '.' || team(i));
    END LOOP;

    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('---');
  END;

BEGIN
  print_team('First Team:');
  team(2) := 'Albert';
  team(5) := 'George';
  print_team('Second Team:');
  team := players('Charles', 'Carl', 'James', 'Gary','Brian');
  print_team('Third Team:');
END;

A varray is applicable to a scenario with the following conditions:

* The maximum number of elements is known.



* The elements are usually accessed in order.






A varray must store or retrieve all elements at the same time, and therefore is inapplicable to scenarios with a large number of elements.
