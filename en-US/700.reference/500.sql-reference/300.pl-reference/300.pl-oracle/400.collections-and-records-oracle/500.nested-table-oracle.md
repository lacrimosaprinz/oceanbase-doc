Nested tables
========================

A nested table is a non-permanent table that can be referenced and simulate an array in a PL program.

You can define a table type and declare this type of variables. Then, you can add records to your PL table and reference the records in a way similar to that of referencing array elements.

The syntax is as follows:

```javascript
TYPE type_name IS TABLE OF
{column_type | variable%TYPE | table.column%TYPE } [NOT NULL] | table%ROWTYPE
```



The following table describes the methods supported for PL nested tables.


| **Method** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EXISTS(n) | Returns True if the nth row exists.  |
| COUNT | Returns the number of rows in the PL table.  |
| FIRST \| LAST | Returns the row numbers of the first and last rows. If the PL table contains no data, a null value is returned.  |
| PRIOR(n) | Returns the row number of the record prior to the nth record in the PL table.  |
| NEXT(n) | Returns the row number of the record after the nth record in the PL table.  |
| DELETE | <ul><li> DELETE: deletes all records from the table.    </li><li> DELETE(n): deletes the nth record from the table.    </li><li> DELETE(m,n): deletes all the records between the row numbers m and n. </li></ul> |



The following shows a sample nested table. After a record is deleted from the PL table, the row numbers of other records do not change.

```javascript
obclient> CREATE TABLE departments(department_id number(4),department_name varchar2(15));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO departments VALUES(10,'Administration');
Query OK, 1 row affected
obclient> INSERT INTO departments VALUES(20,'Marketing');
Query OK, 1 row affected
obclient> INSERT INTO departments VALUES(30,'Purchasing');
Query OK, 1 row affected
obclient> INSERT INTO departments VALUES(40,'Human Resources');
Query OK, 1 row affected
obclient> INSERT INTO departments VALUES(50,'Shipping');
Query OK, 1 row affected
obclient> INSERT INTO departments VALUES(60,'IT');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> DECLARE
    TYPE t_dept_table IS TABLE OF departments%ROWTYPE INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
    tab_department T_DEPT_TABLE;
    v_count number(2) :=6;
BEGIN
    -- Assign values to the table.
    FOR int IN 1 .. v_count LOOP
    SELECT * INTO tab_department(int) FROM departments WHERE department_id=int*10;
    END LOOP;

    -- Output the total number of rows by using the COUNT method.
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(tab_department.COUNT||' ROW(S): ');
    -- Output all rows by using the FIRST and LAST methods.
    FOR int IN TAB_department.FIRST .. TAB_department.LAST LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Department number: '||tab_department(int).department_id);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Department name: '|| tab_department(int).department_name);
    END LOOP;

    -- Check records by using the EXISTS method.
    IF tab_department.EXISTS(5) THEN
       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('ROW 5 EXISTS');
    ELSE
       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('ROW 5 NOT EXISTS');
    END IF;
    -- Delete a range by using the DELETE method.
       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Delete row 2-3');
         tab_department.DELETE(2,3);

    -- Output records in a forward sequence by using the NEXT method.
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Looping from first');
         v_count := 1;
         WHILE v_count IS NOT NULL
         LOOP
             DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(tab_department(v_count).department_id);
             v_count := tab_department.next(v_count);
         END LOOP;

    -- Output records in a backward sequence by using the PRIOR method. Note that the value of COUNT is 4 in this case.
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Looping from last');
          v_count := tab_department.COUNT;
         WHILE v_count IS NOT NULL
         LOOP
             DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(tab_department(v_count).department_id);
             v_count := tab_department.prior(v_count);
         END LOOP;
END;

Major differences between nested tables and arrays
--------------------

In terms of concept, a nested table is a one-dimensional array with any number of elements. Nested tables and arrays are different in the following aspects:

* An array can declare the number of elements but a nested table cannot. The size of a nested table can be dynamically increased.



* An array is always dense. A nested table is initially dense and can become sparse after elements are deleted from it.






Application scenarios of nested tables
-----------------

Nested tables are applicable in the following scenarios:

* The number of elements is not specified.



* The index values are not continuous.



* Some elements need to be deleted or updated, but you cannot delete or update all elements at the same time.
