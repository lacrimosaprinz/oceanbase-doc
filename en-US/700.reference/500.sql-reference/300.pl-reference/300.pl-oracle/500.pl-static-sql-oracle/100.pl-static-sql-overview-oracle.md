Generally, PL static SQL statements use the same syntax as the following SQL statements:

* `SELECT` statement, which is also referred to as a query.

* Data manipulation language (DML) statements: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE`.

* Transaction control language (TCL) statements: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, `SET TRANSACTION`, and `LOCK TABLE`.

A pseudocolumn acts like a normal column, but is not stored in a table. Static SQL supports the following SQL pseudocolumns:

* `CURRVAL` and `NEXTVAL`

* `LEVEL`

* `OBJECT_VALUE`

* `ROWID`

* `ROWNUM`

In OceanBase Database, PL static SQL supports complex data types for return values of SQL statements in the following scenarios:

* `SELECT INTO`/`BULK INTO​`
* `RETURING INTO`/`BULK INTO` in DML statements
* `​FETCH INTO`/`BULK INTO`
