# Overview

When OceanBase Database executes an SQL statement, it stores the result set and processing information in an unnamed private memory area, and sets a pointer to the start value of this memory area. This pointer is referred to as a cursor.

You can get one row of record at a time by using the cursor, and the cursor status is returned as a cursor attribute. Cursors are categorized into explicit cursors and implicit cursors.
