# Implicit cursors

OceanBase Database automatically sets cursors for DML operations such as ALTER and DELETE, and creates workspaces for the cursors. These cursors implicitly created by the system are referred to as implicit cursors and named after SQL cursors, which is defined by OceanBase Database.

  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>
  </main>

Operations on an implicit cursor, such as definition, opening, value assignment, and closing, are all automatically completed by OceanBase Database without the need for manual intervention. You can complete corresponding operations based on related attributes of an implicit cursor. The data stored in the workspace of an implicit cursor is irrelevant to a user-defined explicit cursor, but is the data contained by the last SQL statement that is executed.

An implicit cursor has the following attributes:

* `SQL%FOUND`: a BOOLEAN attribute, which returns `TRUE` if the last read operation returns a record.



* `SQL%NOTFOUND`: a BOOLEAN attribute, which is opposite to `SQL%FOUND`.



* `SQL%ROWCOUNT`: a numeric attribute, which returns the number of records read from the cursor.



* `SQL%ISOPEN`: a BOOLEAN attribute, which is always `FALSE`. The implicit cursor is immediately closed after the SQL statement is executed.






The following example deletes all employees of a department from the `emp` table, and deletes this department from the `dept` table if this department has no employees:

```javascript
obclient> CREATE TABLE dept(  
    deptno           NUMBER(2,0),  
    dname            VARCHAR(15),  
    location         VARCHAR(20),   
   CONSTRAINT pk_dept PRIMARY KEY(deptno)  
);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE emp(  
   empno         NUMBER(4,0),  
   empname       VARCHAR(10),  
    job          VARCHAR(10),  
   mgr           NUMBER(4,0),  
   hiredate      DATE,  
   sal           NUMBER(7,2),  
   comm          NUMBER(7,2),        
   deptno        NUMBER(2,0),   
   CONSTRAINT PK_emp PRIMARY KEY (empno)
);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','Los Angeles');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> INSERT INTO emp VALUES (1839,'KING','PRESIDENT',null,  '1981-11-17',5000,null,10);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> DECLARE
         v_dept_id emp.deptno%TYPE := 10;
     BEGIN
         DELETE FROM emp WHERE deptno=v_dept_id;
         IF SQL%NOTFOUND THEN
             DELETE FROM dept WHERE deptno=v_dept_id;
         END IF;
END;
/
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
