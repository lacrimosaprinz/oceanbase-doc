Traverse cursor data by using the FOR loop
==================================

PL provides easier-to-use `FOR` loop statements to automatically execute the `OPEN`, `FETCH`, and `CLOSE` statements and loop statements of cursors.

When the program enters a loop, the `FOR` loop statement of the cursor automatically opens the cursor and fetches the first row of cursor data. When the program enters the next loop after processing the fetched data, the `FOR` loop statement of the cursor automatically fetches the next row of data for processing by the program. After all data rows are fetched from the result set, the loop is ended and the cursor is automatically closed.

The syntax is as follows:

```javascript
FOR index_variable IN cursor_name[value[, value]...] LOOP
    -- Cursor data processing code
END LOOP;
```



`index_variable` is the index variable implicitly declared by the `FOR` loop statement of the cursor. This index variable does not need to be declared in `DECLARE`. It is of the `RECORD` type. Its structure is the same as that of the result set returned by the cursor query statement.

The program can reference elements in this index variable to read the fetched cursor data. The names of elements in `index_variable` are the same as the column names in the select list of the cursor query statement. If calculation columns exist in the select list of the cursor query statement, you must specify aliases for these calculation columns so that the column data can be accessed by using the index variable in the `FOR` loop statement of the cursor.

Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> CREATE TABLE emp(  
   empno          NUMBER(4,0),  
   empname        VARCHAR(10),  
   job            VARCHAR(10),   
   deptno         NUMBER(2,0),
   salary         NUMERIC  
);
Query OK, 0 rows affected  

obclient> INSERT INTO emp VALUES (200,'Jennifer','AD_ASST',1,15000),(202,'Pat','MK_REP',2,12000),
          (119,'Karen','PU_CLERK', 4,10000),(118,'Guy','PU_CLERK', 4,10000),
         (201,'Michael','MK_MAN',3,9000);
Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 5  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

obclient> DECLARE
         CURSOR c_emp IS SELECT empname, salary
              FROM emp where rownum<5;
      BEGIN
         -- Implicitly open the cursor.
         FOR r_emp IN c_emp LOOP
             -- Implicitly execute the FETCH statement.
             DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(r_emp.empname||'''s salary is '||r_emp.salary );
          -- Implicitly detect c_emp%NOTFOUND.
         END LOOP;
      END;
     /
Query OK, 0 rows affected

Jennifer's salary is 15000
Pat's salary is 12000
Karen's salary is 10000
Guy's salary is 10000
```



When you use the `FOR` loop statement to traverse cursor data, cursor parameters can also be passed. Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> DECLARE
        CURSOR c_emp (in_job varchar default 'AC_MGR' ) IS
             SELECT empname, salary
             FROM emp where job = in_job;
             v_job  emp.job%TYPE;
     BEGIN
         v_job := 'PU_CLERK';
         FOR r_emp IN c_emp(v_job) LOOP
             DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('DEPT '||v_job||': '||r_emp.empname||'''s salary is '||r_emp.salary );
         END LOOP;
     END;
     /
Query OK, 0 rows affected

DEPT PU_CLERK: Karen's salary is 10000
DEPT PU_CLERK: Guy's salary is 10000
```



PL also allows you to use subqueries in a `FOR` loop statement to directly define cursors. Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> BEGIN
        FOR r_emp IN (SELECT empname, salary FROM emp) LOOP
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(r_emp.empname||'''s salary is '||r_emp.salary );
        END LOOP;
     END;
     /
Query OK, 0 rows affected

Jennifer's salary is 15000
Pat's salary is 12000
Karen's salary is 10000
Guy's salary is 10000
Michael's salary is 9000
```
