# Overview

Dynamic SQL is a PL programming capability that allows statements to be generated and executed during the execution of a PL program, achieving high flexibility in programming.

    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>

The following describes the application scenarios of dynamic SQL:

* Complete SQL statements cannot be determined during programming.

* Required operations, such as DDL operations, are not supported by static SQL.

    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>Generally, static SQL provides higher security and efficiency. Therefore, we recommend that you do not use dynamic SQL unless necessary. </p>

In OceanBase Database, PL dynamic SQL supports complex data types for return values of SQL statements in the following scenarios:

* Dynamic SQL execution of `SELECT` statements
* Dynamic SQL execution of DML statements
* Value assignment to an `OUT` parameter in the `USING` clause of the `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement
