# DBMS_SQL system package

The `DBMS_SQL` system package defines an entity called SQL cursor ID. An SQL cursor ID is an integer and therefore can be passed and stored across call boundaries.

    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>
  </main>

If any of the following conditions is met, the `DBMS_SQL` system package must be used to run dynamic SQL statements:

* The content of the `SELECT` list is not known until running.



* The placeholders in the `SELECT` or DML statements to be bound are not known until running.



* The stored subprogram is expected to implicitly return the query results by using the `DBMS_SQL.RETURN_RESULT` stored procedure, rather than by using the `OUT REF CURSOR` parameter.






Dynamic SQL statements rather than the `DBMS_SQL` system package must be used in the following cases:

* Dynamic SQL statements retrieve rows to records.



* The SQL cursor attribute `％FOUND`, `％ISOPEN`, `％NOTFOUND`, or `％ROWCOUNT` needs to be used after the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`, or single-row `SELECT` statement is used to declare a dynamic SQL statement.
