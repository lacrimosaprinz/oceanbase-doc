Overview
=======================

Stored procedures and functions, also called PL programs, are named PL blocks. They exchange information with callers through input and output parameters.

The only difference between stored procedures and functions is that functions always return data to the caller, while stored procedures do not return data to the caller. However, you can use `OUT` parameters to enable stored procedures to return data.

OceanBase Database stores PL programs. These programs can run in any session connected to the database provided that required privileges are granted.
