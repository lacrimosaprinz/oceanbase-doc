Create a stored procedure
===========================

A stored procedure is a pre-compiled collection of SQL statements and optional control flow statements, and is processed as a unit by the procedural language (PL) engine. A stored procedure can reference other stored procedures and return multiple variables.

The syntax for creating a stored procedure is as follows:

```javascript
CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE Procedure_name
[ (argment [ { IN | IN OUT }] Type,
      argment [ { IN | OUT | IN OUT } ] Type ]
    [ AUTHID DEFINER | CURRENT_USER ]
{ IS | AS }
delarification_block
BEGIN
    procedure_body
EXCEPTION
  exception_handler
END;
```



Here is an example of creating a stored procedure that has no parameters:

```javascript
obclient> CREATE TABLE loghistory
      (userid VARCHAR2(20),
      logdate DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE userlogin
      IS
  BEGIN
      INSERT INTO loghistory (userid) VALUES (USER);
  END;
  /
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```



Call a stored procedure
---------------------------

After a stored procedure is created, an authorized user can call and run the procedure from OBClient, OceanBase Developer Center (ODC), or a third-party development tool.

Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> SELECT * FROM loghistory;
Empty set

obclient> BEGIN
     userlogin;
     END;
     /
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM loghistory;
+--------+-----------+
| USERID | LOGDATE   |
+--------+-----------+
| HR     | 27-SEP-20 |
+--------+-----------+
1 row in set

obclient> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```



Subprogram properties
--------------------------

Each subprogram property can appear only once in the subprogram declaration. The properties can appear in any order. Properties appear before the `IS` or `AS` keyword in the subprogram. The properties cannot appear in nested subprograms.

Only the `ACCESSIBLE BY` property can appear in program packages. Standalone subprograms may have the following properties in their declarations:

* `AUTHID`



* `ACCESSIBLE BY`






**AUTHID**

While you define a stored procedure, you can define the `AUTHID` clause to determine whether the stored procedure runs with the privileges of its owner or the current session user. Privileges are divided into the following two types:

* `AUTHID DEFINER`: The definer privileges. By default, the privileges of the stored procedure come from its owner.



* `AUTHID CURRENT_USER`: The caller privileges. The stored procedure runs with the privileges of the current session user, which may be different from the current logged-on user. You can change the caller schema by using `ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA`.






Example: Create a stored procedure `userlogin` as the `HR` user and specify `AUTHID DEFINER`.

```javascript
obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE userlogin
    AUTHID DEFINER
    IS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO loghistory (userid) VALUES (USER);
END;
/
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```



The `HR` user assigns the execution privilege on `userlogin` to public users so that the `scott` user can execute the stored procedure.

```javascript
obclient> SELECT * FROM loghistory;
+--------+-----------+
| USERID | LOGDATE   |
+--------+-----------+
| HR     | 27-SEP-20 |
+--------+-----------+
obclient>GRANT EXECUTE ON userlogin TO PUBLIC;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```



The `scott` user does not have the privilege to access the `hr.loghistory` table but still can execute the stored procedure `userlogin`.

```javascript
obclient> SELECT USER FROM DUAL;
+-------+
| USER  |
+-------+
| SCOTT |
+-------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM loghistory;
ORA-00942: table or view 'SCOTT.LOGHISTORY' does not exist

obclient> SELECT * FROM hr.loghistory;
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist

obclient> BEGIN
     hr.userlogin;
     END;
     /
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```



The `scott` user has inserted data into the `hr.loghistory` table by executing the stored procedure `userlogin` created by the `HR` user. This indicates that the `scott` user has the privileges of the `HR` user during the execution of this stored procedure.

```javascript
obclient> SELECT USER FROM DUAL;
+------+
| USER |
+------+
| HR   |
+------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM hr.loghistory;
+--------+-----------+
| USERID | LOGDATE   |
+--------+-----------+
| HR     | 27-SEP-20 |
| SCOTT  | 27-SEP-20 |
+--------+-----------+
2 rows in set
```



About the `AUTHID CURRENT_USER` clause: Use the `AUTHID CURRENT_USER` clause as the `HR` user to redefine the stored procedure `userlogin`.

```javascript
obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE userlogin
     AUTHID CURRENT_USER
     IS
 BEGIN
     INSERT INTO loghistory (userid) VALUES (USER);
 END;
 /
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```



An error occurs when the `scott` user executes the stored procedure `userlogin` again, because the `scott` user does not have the privilege to access the `hr.loghistory` table. Creating the `loghistory` table as the `scott` user succeeded, but the data is inserted into the `scott.loghistory` table.

```javascript
obclient> SELECT USER FROM DUAL;
+-------+
| USER  |
+-------+
| SCOTT |
+-------+
1 row in set

obclient> BEGIN
     hr.userlogin;
     END;
     /
ORA-00942: table or view 'SCOTT.LOGHISTORY' does not exist

obclient>ALTER SESSION SET current_schema=hr;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> BEGIN
     hr.userlogin;
     END;
     /
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist

obclient>ALTER SESSION SET current_schema=scott;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE loghistory
     (userid VARCHAR2(20),
     logdate date default sysdate);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> BEGIN
     hr.userlogin;
     END;
     /
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM loghistory;
+--------+-----------+
| USERID | LOGDATE   |
+--------+-----------+
| SCOTT  | 27-SEP-20 |
+--------+-----------+
1 row in set
```



**ACCESSIBLE BY**

`ACCESSIBLE BY` can constrain the caller of an object.

The accessor list explicitly lists units that may have access. The accessor list can be defined on a subprogram package. The program package will check the accessor list (if any) it defines. To prevent unnecessary calls to internal subprograms, the accessor list may limit only access to subprograms and cannot extend the access. For example, a program package cannot be reorganized into two program packages, with one used for limiting access to a few users and the other used for public access.

The `ACCESSIBLE BY` clause may appear in the declarations of object types, object type bodies, packages, and subprograms.

The `ACCESSIBLE BY` clause can appear in the following SQL statements:

* `ALTER TYPE`



* `CREATE FUNCTION`



* `CREATE PROCEDURE`



* `CREATE PACKAGE`



* `CREATE TYPE`



* `CREATE TYPE BODY`






The syntax is as follows:

```javascript
unit_kind:
  FUNCTION { $$[0] = SP_FUNCTION; }
  | PROCEDURE { $$[0] = SP_PROCEDURE; }
  | PACKAGE_P { $$[0] = SP_PACKAGE; }
  | TRIGGER { $$[0] = SP_TRIGGER; }
  | TYPE { $$[0] = SP_TYPE; }
;

accessor:
  pl_schema_name
  {
    malloc_non_terminal_node($$, parse_ctx->mem_pool_, T_SP_ACCESSOR, 2, NULL, $1);
  }
  | unit_kind pl_schema_name
  {
    ParseNode *accessor_kind = NULL;
    malloc_terminal_node(accessor_kind, parse_ctx->mem_pool_, T_SP_ACCESSOR_KIND);
    accessor_kind->value_ = $1[0];
    malloc_non_terminal_node($$, parse_ctx->mem_pool_, T_SP_ACCESSOR, 2, accessor_kind, $2);
  }
;

accessor_list:
    accessor_list ',' accessor
    {
      malloc_non_terminal_node($$, parse_ctx->mem_pool_, T_LINK_NODE, 2, $1, $3);
    }
  | accessor
    {
      $$ = $1;
    }
;

accessible_by:
  ACCESSIBLE BY '(' accessor_list ')'
  {
    ParseNode *accessor_list = NULL;
    merge_nodes(accessor_list, parse_ctx->mem_pool_, T_SP_ACCESSOR_LIST, $4);
    malloc_non_terminal_node($$, parse_ctx->mem_pool_, T_SP_ACCESSIBLE_BY, 1, accessor_list);
  }
;
```



Autonomous transactions
-------------------------

OceanBase Database supports autonomous transactions. Autonomous transactions are fully independent of the main transaction. Committing or rolling back an autonomous transaction does not affect the main transaction.

Create an object based on the following example:

```javascript
-- Create a log table.
CREATE TABLE logtable(
    username VARCHAR2(20),
    date_time DATE,
    message VARCHAR2(60)
);
-- Create a temporary table.
CREATE TABLE demotable( N number);

-- Create a procedure that owns autonomous transactions.
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE log_message(p_message varchar2)
    AS
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO logtable VALUES ( user, sysdate, p_message );
    COMMIT;
END log_message;
```



Then, perform the following steps:

1. Call `log_message` to write a log.



2. Insert data into the `demotable` table during the transaction.



3. Call `log_message` again to write another log.



4. Roll back the current transaction.






```javascript
obclient> SELECT * FROM logtable;
Empty set

obclient> SELECT * FROM demotable;
Empty set

obclient> BEGIN
         Log_message ('About to insert into demotable.');
         INSERT INTO demotable VALUES (1);
         Log_message ('Rollback the transaction.');
         ROLLBACK;
     END;
     /
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM logtable;
+----------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| USERNAME | DATE_TIME | MESSAGE                         |
+----------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| HR       | 28-SEP-20 | About to insert into demotable.
| HR       | 28-SEP-20 | Rollback the transaction.
+----------+-----------+---------------------------------+
2 rows in set
```



In the preceding example, the INSERT operation on the `demotable` table was rolled back. The stored procedure `log_message` that has autonomous transactions has committed only its own transactions and written data into the log table.

Re-create the stored procedure `log_message`, remove the autonomous transaction property, and view the database behavior.

```javascript
obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE log_message(p_message varchar2)
    AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO logtable VALUES ( user, sysdate, p_message );
    COMMIT;
END log_message;
/
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```



Execute the preceding stored procedure again:

```javascript
obclient> SELECT * FROM logtable;
Empty set

obclient> SELECT * FROM demotable;
Empty set

obclient> BEGIN
         Log_message ('About to insert into demotable.');
         INSERT INTO demotable VALUES (1);
         Log_message ('Rollback the transaction.');
         ROLLBACK;
     END;
     /
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM logtable;
+----------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| USERNAME | DATE_TIME | MESSAGE                         |
+----------+-----------+---------------------------------+
| HR       | 28-SEP-20 | About to insert into demotable.
| HR       | 28-SEP-20 | Rollback the transaction.
+----------+-----------+---------------------------------+
2 rows in set

obclient>SELECT * FROM demotable;
+------+
| N    |
+------+
|    1 |
+------+
1 row in set
```



Compare the two execution processes. In the second execution, transactions on `demotable` were not rolled back. If autonomous transactions are not used, all modifications are made in the same transaction. When the stored procedure `log_message` is executed for the second time, the `COMMIT` statement commits the entire transaction, including `INSERT INTO demotable VALUES (1)`.
