View stored procedures and functions
------------------------------

Stored procedures and functions are stored in the database dictionaries. The following are several common dictionary views:

* `DBA_SOURCE`: displays all stored procedures and functions.



* `ALL_SOURCE`: displays all stored procedures and functions that can be accessed by the current user.



* `USER_SOURCE`: displays all stored procedures and functions owned by the current user.






Example: View all the stored procedures of the `HR` user in the `DBA_SOURCE` view.

```javascript
obclient> SELECT OWNER,NAME,TYPE FROM DBA_SOURCE
      WHERE OWNER='HR' AND TYPE='PROCEDURE';
+-------+-------------+-----------+
| OWNER | NAME        | TYPE      |
+-------+-------------+-----------+
| HR    | AAA         | PROCEDURE |
| HR    | USERLOGIN   | PROCEDURE |
| HR    | LOG_MESSAGE | PROCEDURE |
+-------+-------------+-----------+
```



Example: View the content of the `log_message` stored procedure owned by the current user in the `USER_SOURCE` view.

```javascript
obclient> SELECT TEXT FROM USER_SOURCE WHERE NAME='log_message' AND
     TYPE='PROCEDURE'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
TEXT: PROCEDURE log_message(p_message varchar2)
    AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO logtable VALUES ( user, sysdate, p_message );   
    COMMIT;
END log_message
1 row in set
```



Drop stored procedures and functions
------------------------------

The syntax for dropping a stored procedure is as follows:

```javascript
DROP PROCEDURE [user.]Procedure_name;
```



The syntax for dropping a function is as follows:

```javascript
DROP FUNCTION [user.]Function_name;
```



Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> DROP PROCEDURE log_message;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
