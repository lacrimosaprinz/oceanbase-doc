Use user-defined aggregate functions
================================

You can use user-defined aggregate functions in SQL DML statements, just like using built-in aggregate functions. User-defined aggregate functions can appear in the `SELECT` list, `ORDER BY` clause, or, as part of the predicate, in the `HAVING` clause.

This topic still takes `SecMax()` as an example to show how you can use a user-defined aggregate function.

The following example uses a user-defined aggregate function in the `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT SecMax(salary), deptno
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno
HAVING SecMax(salary) > 6000;
```
