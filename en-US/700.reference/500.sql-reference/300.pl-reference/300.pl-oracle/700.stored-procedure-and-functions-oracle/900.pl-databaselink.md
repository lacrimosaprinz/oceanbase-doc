# PL DBLink

OceanBase Database allows you to remotely call a PL stored procedure. Currently, you can call stored procedures in standalone procedures or PL packages. You cannot remotely call functions in UDFs or PL packages. 

The syntax for remotely calling a PL stored procedure in OceanBase Database is as follows:

```sql
CALL [pakage_name.]sp_name@dblink_name([parameter[,..]])
```

In the preceding syntax, `sp_name` specifies the name of the stored procedure to be called, `@dblink_name` specifies the name of the DBLink, indicating that the specified `sp_name` object to be called is a remote stored procedure, and `pakage_name.` specifies the name of the PL package. 

The following example remotely calls the standalone procedure `proc1` and the `proc2` procedure in the PL package `pl_pkg1` by using the DBLink named `dblink_test`. 

```shell
CALL proc1@dblink_test(1);
CALL pl_pkg1.proc2@dblink_test(1);
```

A remote call of a PL stored procedure supports output and input parameters of basic types, including string types such as `VARCHAR2`, `VARCHAR`, and `CHAR`, numeric types such as `NUMBER`, `INT`, `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, and `DOUBLE`, and `DATE` and `TIMESTAMP` types. 

The following example remotely calls a PL stored procedure with an input parameter of the `VARCHAR2` type. 

```shell

DELIMITER /

DECLARE
    v1 VARCHAR2(10);
BEGIN
    proc3@dblink(1, v1);
END;
/
```

You can also remotely call data types defined in a PL package in a PL block by using a DBLink. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
DECLARE
    var_name package_name.type_name[@dblink_name]
BEGIN
    ...
END;
```

`DECLARE` defines a variable specified by `var_name`. The data type, specified by `type_name`, of the variable is defined in the package specified by `package_name` in the remote DBLink library specified by `dblink_name`. 

The remote call of a PL stored procedure supports output and input parameters of complex data types defined in the package, including record types, nested tables, and associate arrays. The elements of a record type can only be the aforementioned basic data types. The elements of a nested table and an associate array can only be the aforementioned basic data types and the record type. 

For Oracle Database of version 12c and earlier, data types defined in a package must be the types defined in `FUNCTION` or `PROCEDURE` parameters in the package. Remote calls are not supported if the data types are defined only in the package, but are not used in any `FUNCTION` or `PROCEDURE` parameters in the package. This limitation does not apply to Oracle Database of later versions. 

The following example remotely defines a package named `pkg1` and its data types, and remotely calls the data types defined in the package. 

```shell
/* Remotely define a package named pkg1 */

DELIMITER /

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE pkg1 AS
    TYPE ty1 IS RECORD(c1 VARCHAR2(10), c2 INT);
    TYPE ty2 IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(10);
    TYPE ty3 IS TABLE OF ty1;
    TYPE ty4 IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(10) INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
    TYPE ty5 IS TABLE OF ty1 INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
    TYPE ty6 IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(10);
    PROCEDURE proc4(param1 ty1, param2 ty2, param3 ty3 , param4 ty4, param5 ty5);
END;
/

/* Remotely call the data types defined in the package pkg1 */
DECLARE
    v1 pkg1.ty1@dblink_test;
    v2 pkg1.ty2@dblink_test;
    v3 pkg1.ty3@dblink_test;
    v4 pkg1.ty4@dblink_test;
    v4 pkg1.ty5@dblink_test;
BEGIN
    pkg1.proc4@dblink_test(v1, v2, v3, v4, v5);
END;
/

/* Remote calls in the following scenarios are not supported because ty6 does not appear in the parameter list of the internal procedure proc4 of pkg1: */

DECLARE
    v1 pkg1.ty6@dblink_test;
BEGIN
    NULL;
END;
```

OceanBase Database also supports synonyms when you remotely call PL stored procedures and packages, and allows you to locally create synonyms for remote PL objects. 

```shell
/* Create a synonym for the remote PL stored procedure proc5. */
CREATE OR REPLACE SYNONYM syn_remote_p1 FOR proc5;


/* Locally create a synonym for the remote PL stored procedure proc6.
CREATE OR REPLACE SYNONYM syn_local_p1 FOR proc6@oci_link;
```

The following example calls a remote PL stored procedure. 

```shell
CALL proc5@dblink_test(1);
CALL syn_remote_p1@dblink_test(1);
CALL syn_local_p1(1);
```
