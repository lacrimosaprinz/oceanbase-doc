Modify a trigger
--------------------------

To modify a trigger, you can use only the `REPLACE TRIGGER` statement. This statement is a DDL statement.

Generally, you can use the following syntax to create or modify a trigger:

```javascript
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trigger_name ...
```



If the value of `trigger_name` does not exist, the trigger is created. If the value of `trigger_name` exists, the trigger is modified.

Drop a trigger
--------------------------

You can use the `DROP TRIGGER` statement to drop a trigger. The syntax is as follows:

```javascript
DROP TRIGGER trigger_name;
```



When you drop a table, the triggers created on the table are also dropped.
