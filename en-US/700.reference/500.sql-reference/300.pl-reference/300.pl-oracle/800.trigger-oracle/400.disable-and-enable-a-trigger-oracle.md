# Disable or enable a trigger

You can disable and enable triggers in some Procedural Language (PL) scenarios.

  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>
  </main>

You may need to temporarily disable a trigger in the following scenarios:

* The trigger cannot be compiled because a database object that the trigger depends on does not exist.



* The logic of the trigger does not meet your business needs.



* You want to load, modify, or delete a large amount of data without executing any trigger.






You can enable a disabled trigger as needed.

You can use the `ALTER TRIGGER` statement in conjunction with a `DISABLE` or an `ENABLE` clause to enable or disable a trigger.

Disable a trigger by using the following syntax:

```javascript
ALTER TRIGGER trigger_name DISABLE;
```



Enable a trigger by using the following syntax:

```javascript
ALTER TRIGGER trigger_name ENABLE;
```
