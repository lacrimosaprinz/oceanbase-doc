# Compound DML trigger

You can create a compound DML trigger on a table or an editable view. The trigger can fire at multiple timing points. A compound trigger is sectioned based on each timing point. Each timing point section has its own executable part and exception-handling part (optional).

## Syntax

The syntax of the simplest compound DML trigger is as follows:

```sql
CREATE trigger_name FOR dml_event_clause ON view_name
COMPOUND TRIGGER
INSTEAD OF EACH ROW IS BEGIN
  sql_statement;
END INSTEAD OF EACH ROW;
```

The declarative part (optional) of a compound DML trigger defines variables and subprograms. When the trigger fires, the declarative part runs first, and the variables and subprograms defined in the declarative part exist in the timing point sections to which the triggering statement applies.

A compound DML trigger contains at least one timing point section, as shown in the following table. Multiple timing point sections in a compound DML trigger can be sorted in any order, but the timing points cannot be duplicate.

| **Timing point** | **Section** |
| --- | --- |
| Before the triggering statement runs | BEFORE STATEMENT |
| After the triggering statement runs | AFTER STATEMENT |
| Before each row affected by the triggering statement | BEFORE EACH ROW |
| After each row affected by the triggering statement | AFTER EACH ROW |

A compound DML trigger has no initialization part. However, `BEFORE STATEMENT` can run prior to other timing point sections and therefore can be used for initialization. If a compound DML trigger has neither the `BEFORE STATEMENT` part nor the `AFTER STATEMENT` part and its triggering statement does not affect any rows, this compound trigger will never fire.

## Limitations on compound DML triggers

Compound DML triggers are subject to the following limitations:

* `OLD`, `NEW`, and `PARENT` cannot appear in the declarative part, `BEFORE STATEMENT` part, or `AFTER STATEMENT` part.
* Only the `BEFORE EACH ROW` part can change the value of `NEW`.
* One timing point section cannot handle the exceptions raised in another timing point section.
* If a timing point section contains the `GOTO` statement, the destination of the `GOTO` statement must be in the same timing point section.

## Advantages of compound DML triggers

You can use a compound DML trigger with bulk SQL statements or when the triggering statement affects many rows, to improve performance.

In the following example, the triggering statement fires a compound DML trigger that contains four timing point sections. The `BEFORE EACH ROW` and `AFTER EACH ROW` parts of the trigger run for each row in the `tbl1` table where the `col1` column is greater than the `col2` column. However, the `BEFORE STATEMENT` part runs only before the `INSERT` statement, and the `AFTER STATEMENT` part runs only after the `INSERT` statement.

```sql
INSERT INTO tbl2
  SELECT col1
  FROM tbl1
  WHERE tbl1.col1 > col2;
```

In addition, you can use a compound DML trigger with bulk INSERT statements. The compound DML trigger accumulates rows and then sends them to other tables, to insert data in batches on a regular basis. You can also use compound DML triggers to avoid mutating-table errors with the error code of ORA-04091.


## Examples

Use a compound trigger to record the changes in the child table of a table.

```sql
  obclient> CREATE TABLE emp_sal (
      emp_id NUMBER NOT NULL,
      change_date DATE   NOT NULL,
      salary NUMBER(8,2) NOT NULL,
      FOREIGN KEY (emp_id)
      REFERENCES employees (employee_id) ON DELETE CASCADE);
  Query OK, 0 rows affected

  obclient> delimiter /

  obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER maintain_emp_sal
  FOR UPDATE OF salary ON employees
    COMPOUND TRIGGER

  threshhold CONSTANT SIMPLE_INTEGER := 3;

  TYPE sal_typ IS TABLE OF emp_sal%ROWTYPE INDEX BY SIMPLE_INTEGER;
  sal  sal_typ;
  idx  SIMPLE_INTEGER := 0;

  PROCEDURE flush_proc IS
    n CONSTANT SIMPLE_INTEGER := sal.count();
  BEGIN
    FORALL j IN 1..n
      INSERT INTO emp_sal VALUES sal(j);
    sal.delete();
    idx := 0;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Flushed' || n || 'rows');
  END flush_proc;

  -- AFTER EACH ROW timing point section:

  AFTER EACH ROW IS
  BEGIN
    idx := idx + 1;
    sal(idx).emp_id := :NEW.employee_id;
    sal(idx).change_date := SYSTIMESTAMP;
    sal(idx).salary := :NEW.salary;
    IF idx >= threshhold THEN
      flush_proc();
    END IF;
  END AFTER EACH ROW;

  -- AFTER STATEMENT timing point section:

  AFTER STATEMENT IS
  BEGIN
    flush_proc();
  END AFTER STATEMENT;
END maintain_emp_sal;
