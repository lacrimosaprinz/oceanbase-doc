# RPC message compression

OBKV supports message compression for RPC when responding to query requests. By default, RPC compression is disabled. OBKV provides the following parameters to enable RPC compression and control the compression threshold:

- `kv_transport_compress_func`
    The default value is `none`. Four compression algorithms are supported: lz4_1.0, snappy_1.0, zstd_1.0, and zstd 1.3.8.
- `kv_transport_compress_threshold`
    The default value is `10K`. After `kv_transport_compress_func` is set, compression will only be performed when the query result set exceeds the threshold.

Here is an example:

```shell
alter system set kv_transport_compress_func="lz4_1.0";
alter system set kv_transport_compress_threshold='1M';
```
