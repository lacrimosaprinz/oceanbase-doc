# oceanbase.DBA_WR_SQLSTAT

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.2. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `oceanbase.DBA_WR_SQLSTAT` view displays the basic performance statistics of SQL statements executed in the current tenant. Each row displays information about an SQL statement, including the values of `SQL_ID` and `Plan_Hash`. The value of the column whose name ends with `_DELTA` indicates the statistical increment from the last workload repository (WR) snapshot to the current time.
