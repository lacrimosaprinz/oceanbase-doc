# GV$OB_TABLET_COMPACTION_HISTORY

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_TABLET_COMPACTION_HISTORY` view displays the tablet-level compaction history.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

## Columns

| Column | Type | **Nullable?** | Description |
|--------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| SVR_IP | varchar(46) | NO | The IP address of the server. |
| SVR_PORT | bigint(20) | NO | The port number of the server. |
| TENANT_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the tenant. |
| LS_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the log stream. |
| TABLET_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the tablet. |
| TYPE | varchar(64) | NO | The compaction type. Valid values: <li> `MINI`: minor or L0 compaction that converts MemTables into SSTables.   <li> `MAJOR`: major compaction.   <li> `MINI MINOR`: L1 compaction that combines multiple mini SSTables into one.   <li> `BUF MINOR`: buffer minor compaction that generates special buffer minor SSTables. |
| COMPACTION_SCN | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The major compaction version. |
| START_TIME | timestamp(6) | NO | The start time. |
| FINISH_TIME | timestamp(6) | NO | The end time. |
| TASK_ID | varchar(64) | NO | The task execution trace. |
| OCCUPY_SIZE | bigint(20) | NO | The data amount. |
| MACRO_BLOCK_COUNT | bigint(20) | NO | The number of macroblocks. |
| MULTIPLEXED_MACRO_BLOCK_COUNT | bigint(20) | NO | The number of reused macroblocks. |
| NEW_MICRO_COUNT_IN_NEW_MACRO | bigint(20) | NO | The number of new microblocks in a newly generated macroblock. |
| MULTIPLEXED_MICRO_COUNT_IN_NEW_MACRO | bigint(20) | NO | The number of reused microblocks in a newly generated macroblock. |
| TOTAL_ROW_COUNT | bigint(20) | NO | The total number of rows. |
| INCREMENTAL_ROW_COUNT | bigint(20) | NO | The number of new rows. |
| COMPRESSION_RATIO | double | NO | The compression ratio of new data, which is the ratio of the size of compressed new macroblock data to the data size before compression. |
| NEW_FLUSH_DATA_RATE | bigint(20) | NO | The output speed of new data. Unit: KB/s. |
| PROGRESSIVE_COMPACTION_ROUND | bigint(20) | NO | The current compaction round during a progressive compaction. For a full compaction, the value is -1. |
| PROGRESSIVE_COMPACTION_NUM | bigint(20) | NO | The total number of compaction rounds in a progressive compaction. |
| PARALLEL_DEGREE | bigint(20) | NO | The degree of parallelism. |
| PARALLEL_INFO | varchar(512) | NO | The parallel task information, including the scanned data amount, operating time, and output data amount of the parallel task. |
| PARTICIPANT_TABLE | varchar(512) | NO | The table that participates in the compaction. |
| MACRO_ID_LIST | varchar(256) | NO | The list of output macroblocks. If the macroblock list is too long, it is not displayed. |
| COMMENTS | varchar(256) | NO | The history of failed compactions and the collection duration of the current compaction. |
