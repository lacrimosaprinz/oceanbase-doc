# GV$OB_FLT_TRACE_CONFIG

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_FLT_TRACE_CONFIG` view displays the end-to-end diagnostics information.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Nullable? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TENANT_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The tenant ID. </li><li>Other values: user tenant or meta tenant ID.</li></ul> |
| TYPE | varchar(16) | NO | The monitoring level of the diagnostics information.  </li><li>module/action level: Monitors the diagnostics information at the module and action level.</li><li>client_identifier level: Monitors the diagnostics information at the client identifier level. </li></ul> |
| TENANT_NAME | varchar(128) | NO | The tenant name. |
| MODULE_NAME | varchar(4096) | NO | The module name. |
| ACTION_NAME | varchar(4096) | NO | The action name. |
| CLIENT_IDENTIFIER | varchar(65) | NO | The client identifier name. |
| LEVEL | bigint(20) | NO | Indicates the end-to-end diagnostics monitoring level for this session. For example, 1 indicates the diagnostics information with level 1. |
| SAMPLE_PERCENTAGE | bigint(20) | NO | Indicates the sampling frequency for end-to-end diagnostics for this session. For example, 50 indicates diagnostics information is sampled with a frequency of 50%. |
| RECORD_POLICY | varchar(32) | NO | Indicates the end-to-end diagnostics recording policy for this session. It mainly supports the following three policies: <ul><li>ALL: All trace point information that matches the sampling requirements is printed to the log file, and it is printed to the log file at the end of each span. </li><li>ONLY_SLOW_QUERY: Among all trace point information that matches the sampling requirements, trace requests that are slow queries are printed to the log file, while the rest are discarded. For this printing policy, trace logs are printed after the request is determined to be a slow query. In the proxy, for the root span, which is the transaction-level span, it is printed only when a slow query is detected. </li><li>SAMPLE_AND_SLOW_QUERY: Among all trace point information that matches the sampling requirements, trace points meeting the following conditions are all printed to the log file:<ol><li>When using the hidden parameter <code>_print_sample_ppm</code> for a one-in-ten-thousand probability sampling, and only when the sampling result is selected, it will be printed to the log. </li><li>Meets the printing conditions under `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY` mode. </li></ol>Under this mode, the timing of log printing is not at the end of the span. If condition 1 is met, the trace log is forcibly printed at the client side, and this information is passed to the subsequent link components: If condition 2 is met, the timing of printing is the same as for `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY`.</li></ul> |
