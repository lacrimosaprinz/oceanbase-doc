USER_OBJECTS
=================================

Purpose
-----------

The `USER_OBJECTS` view displays all database objects owned by the current user. Its columns are the same as those of the `ALL_OBJECTS` view, except that it does not have the `OWNER` column. This is because the owner is the current user.
