# GV$OB_FLT_TRACE_CONFIG

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_FLT_TRACE_CONFIG` view provides information about end-to-end diagnostics. 

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p>
</main>

## Columns

| **Column** | **Type** | **Nullable?** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TENANT_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the tenant. </li><li>Other values: a user tenant or meta tenant. </li></ul> |
| TYPE | VARCHAR2(16) | NO | The monitoring level of the diagnostics information. Valid values:  </li><li>`module/action`: Diagnostics are monitored based on modules and actions. </li><li>`client_identifier`: Diagnostics are monitored based on client identifiers. </li></ul> |
| TENANT_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The name of the tenant. |
| MODULE_NAME | VARCHAR2(4096) | NO | The name of the module. |
| ACTION_NAME | VARCHAR2(4096) | NO | The name of the action. |
| CLIENT_IDENTIFIER | VARCHAR2(65) | NO | The client identifier. |
| LEVEL | NUMBER(38) | NO | The monitoring level of end-to-end diagnostics of the session. For example, the value `1` indicates level-1 diagnostics. |
| SAMPLE_PERCENTAGE | NUMBER(38) | NO | The sampling frequency for end-to-end diagnostics of the session.  For example, the value `50` indicates that diagnostics are sampled at the frequency of 50%. |
| RECORD_POLICY | VARCHAR2(32) | NO | The recording strategy for end-to-end diagnostics of the session. Three strategies are supported:<ul><li>`ALL`: All sampling-enabled traces that are hit are recorded in the log file immediately after each span ends.  </li><li>`ONLY_SLOW_QUERY`: Among sampling-enabled traces that are hit, only traces of slow queries are recorded in the log file, and other traces are discarded. For this strategy, trace logs are recorded after a request ends and is determined as a slow query. In the proxy, the root span (transaction-level span) is immediately recorded when a slow query is detected.  </li><li>`SAMPLE_AND_SLOW_QUERY`: Among sampling-enabled traces that are hit, those meeting any of the following conditions are recorded in the log file:<ol><li>The hidden parameter <code>_print_sample_ppm</code> is used for sampling at a frequency of 0.01% and the sampling result is hit.</li><li>The condition specified in the `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY` strategy is met.</li></ol>In this mode, the logging time varies based on the situation. Specifically, if Condition 1 is met, it is marked on the client that the trace log will be forcibly recorded and this information will be transferred to subsequent components on the link. If Condition 2 is met, the logging time is the same as that in the `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY` strategy. </li></ul> |
