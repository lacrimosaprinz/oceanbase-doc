<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.2. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `V$OB_SESS_TIME_MODEL` view displays the session-level time model statistical items on the current node.

## Columns

| **Column** | **Type** | **Nullable?** | **Description** |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| SID | NUMBER | No | The session ID. |
| TENANT_ID | NUMBER | No | The ID of the tenant. |
| SVR_IP | VARCHAR2(46) | No | The IP address of the server. |
| SVR_PORT | NUMBER(38) | No | The port number of the server. |
| STAT_ID | NUMBER | No | The ID of the statistical item. |
| STAT_NAME | VARCHAR2(64) | No | The name of the statistical item. |
| VALUE | NUMBER | No | The value of the statistical item. |

The following table describes the name and ID of the statistical event in the `STAT_NAME` column of the view.

| Event name | Description | Event ID | Event class |
| ------------|------|------------|----------------|
| DB time | The total duration of database activities, which is the sum of the CPU time and non-idle wait time. | 200001 | 3072 |
| DB CPU | The CPU time consumed for database activities. | 200002 | 3072 |
| background elapsed time | The total execution time of background processes. | 200005 | 3072 |
| background cpu time | The CPU time consumed by background processes. | 200006 | 3072 |
| non idle wait time | The total duration of non-idle waits, when the session was waiting but not idle. | 200010 | 3072 |
| idle wait time | The total duration of idle waits, when the session was waiting in idleness. | 200011 | 3072 |
| background database time | The total duration of database operations performed by background processes. | 200012 | 3072 |
| background database non-idle wait time | The total waiting duration of background processes for performing database operation tasks in the non-idle state. | 200013 | 3072 |
| background database idle wait time | The total waiting duration of background processes for performing database operation tasks in the idle state. | 200014 | 3072 |
| concurrency wait total time | The total duration of the wait event caused by concurrency issues, such as the waiting duration for resource locks. | 220001 | 3072 |
| user io wait total time | The total time a user process waits for an I/O operation, such as the data write to or data read from a disk, to complete. | 220002 | 3072 |
| application wait total time | The total duration of waits caused by the user application code, caused by user application code, such as a lock wait event caused by a row lock or by an explicit lock command. | 2200013 | 3072 |

## Example

```shell
obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.V$OB_SESS_TIME_MODEL WHERE ROWNUM = 1;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+---------------+-----------+----------------+----------+---------+--------------------+-------+
| SID           | TENANT_ID | SVR_IP         | SVR_PORT | STAT_ID | STAT_NAME          | VALUE |
+---------------+-----------+----------------+----------+---------+--------------------+-------+
| 4947802324992 |      1004 | 172.xx.xxx.xxx |     2882 |  200010 | non idle wait time |     0 |
+---------------+-----------+----------------+----------+---------+--------------------+-------+
