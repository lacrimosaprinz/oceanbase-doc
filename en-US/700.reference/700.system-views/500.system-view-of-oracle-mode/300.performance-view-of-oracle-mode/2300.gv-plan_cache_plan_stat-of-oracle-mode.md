# GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The view name is changed from <code>GV$PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT</code> to <code>GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT</code> since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT` view displays the status of each object cached by the current tenant in the plan cache on all OBServer nodes.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>This view caches both SQL plan objects and Procedural Language (PL) objects (such as anonymous blocks, PL packages, and PL functions). Some columns take effect only for specific objects. </p>
  </main>

Valid values:  <ul><li> `1`: indicates a local plan.  </li><li> `2`: indicates a remote plan. </li><li>`3`: indicates a distributed plan.  </li></ul>For PL object caching, this column indicates the type of the PL object. Valid values:<ul><li> `1`: indicates a procedure.    </li><li> `2`: indicates a function. </li><li>`3`: indicates a package.  </li><li> `4`: indicates an anonymous block.   </li></ul> |

| SCHEMA_VERSION | NUMBER(38) | NO | The version of the schema. |
| MERGED_VERSION        | NUMBER(38)                        | NO             | The merged version number corresponding to the current cached plan.   |
