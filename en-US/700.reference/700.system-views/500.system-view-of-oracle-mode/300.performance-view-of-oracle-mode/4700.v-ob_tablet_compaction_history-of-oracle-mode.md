# V$OB_TABLET_COMPACTION_HISTORY

## Purpose

The `V$OB_TABLET_COMPACTION_HISTORY` view displays the tablet-level compaction history.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

## Columns

| Column | Type | Nullable? | Description |
|--------------------------------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| SVR_IP | VARCHAR2(46) | NO | The IP address of the server. |
| SVR_PORT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The port number of the server. |
| TENANT_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the tenant. |
| LS_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the log stream. |
| TABLET_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the tablet. |
| TYPE | VARCHAR2(64) | NO | The compaction type. Valid values: <li> `MINI`: minor or L0 compaction that converts MemTables into SSTables.   <li> `MAJOR`: major compaction.   <li> `MINI MINOR`: L1 compaction that combines multiple mini SSTables into one.   <li> `BUF MINOR`: buffer minor compaction that generates special buffer minor SSTables. |
| COMPACTION_SCN | NUMBER(38) | NO | The compaction version. The minor version is a snapshot version. |
| START_TIME | TIMESTAMP(6) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | NO | The start time. |
| FINISH_TIME | TIMESTAMP(6) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | NO | The end time. |
| OCCUPY_SIZE | NUMBER(38) | NO | The data amount. |
| MACRO_BLOCK_COUNT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of macroblocks. |
| MULTIPLEXED_MACRO_BLOCK_COUNT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of reused macroblocks. |
| NEW_MICRO_COUNT_IN_NEW_MACRO | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of new microblocks in a newly generated macroblock. |
| MULTIPLEXED_MICRO_COUNT_IN_NEW_MACRO | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of reused microblocks in a newly generated macroblock. |
| TOTAL_ROW_COUNT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total number of rows. |
| INCREMENTAL_ROW_COUNT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of new rows. |
| COMPRESSION_RATIO | NUMBER(38) | NO | The compression ratio of new data, which is the ratio of the size of compressed new macroblock data to the data size before compression. |
| PROGRESSIVE_COMPACTION_ROUND | NUMBER(38) | NO | The current compaction round during a progressive compaction. For a full compaction, the value is `-1`. |
| PROGRESSIVE_COMPACTION_NUM | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total number of compaction rounds in a progressive compaction. |
| PARALLEL_DEGREE | NUMBER(38) | NO | The degree of parallelism. |
| PARALLEL_INFO | VARCHAR2(512) | NO | The parallel task information, including the scanned data amount, operating time, and output data amount of the parallel task. |
| MACRO_ID_LIST | varchar2(256) | NO | The list of output macroblocks. If the macroblock list is too long, it is not displayed. |
| COMMENTS | varchar2(256) | NO | The history of failed compactions and the collection duration of the current compaction. |
