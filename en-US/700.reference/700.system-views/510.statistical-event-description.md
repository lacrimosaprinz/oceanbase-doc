# Common statistical events

## Overview

This topic provides an overview of some statistical event information stored in the `V$SYSSTAT` view. These statistical data can help identify and troubleshoot performance issues. The `V$SESSTAT` view provides statistical event information for each session. Statistical event information is only valid for the current connected session, and when a session is disconnected, all the statistical event information for that session is updated in the `V$SESSTAT` view: the values of statistical event information are cleared, and new values are generated for the next session connection. Many statistical events are associated with internal implementations, so they may be subject to changes or removals. Please refer to the actual situation for specific details.

## View statistical events

You can use an SQL statement to display all statistical events and their types in alphabetical order in the sys tenant. Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT name FROM v$statname ORDER BY name;
```
