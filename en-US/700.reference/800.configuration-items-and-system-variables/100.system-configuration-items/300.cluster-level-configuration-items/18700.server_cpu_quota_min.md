## Attributes

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------|
| Type | Double-precision floating-point number |
| Default value | 0, which indicates adaptive adjustment |
| Value range | \[0, 16]  <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><ul><li>Starting from OceanBase Database V4.0.0, the default value is changed from 2.5 to 1, and the value range is changed from [0, 16] to [1, 16].   </li><li>Starting from OceanBase Database V4.2.1, the default value is changed from 1 to 0, and the value range is changed from [1, 16] to [0, 16].  </li></ul></main> |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |

## Considerations

The value `0` indicates that this parameter is adaptively modified based on the value of `cpu_count` for the OBServer node. If the value of `cpu_count` is less than or equal to `8c`, the value of `server_cpu_quota_min` is adaptively changed to `1c`. If the value of `cpu_count` is greater than `8c`, the value of `server_cpu_quota_min` is adaptively changed to `2c`.
