# log_archive_concurrency

<main id="notice" type='explain'>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>The effective scope is changed to Tenant since OceanBase Database V4.1.0. Starting from OceanBase Database V4.2.0, the default value is changed from 1 to 0, and the value range is changed from [1, 100] to [0, 100]. </p>

</main>

## Description

`log_archive_concurrency` specifies the concurrency of log archiving. 

## Attributes

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Integer |
| Default value | 0, which indicates that the concurrency of log archiving changes adaptively in OceanBase Database. |
| Value range | \[0, 100] |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |

## Considerations

The number of archiving worker threads is calculated based on the tenant's `max_cpu` adaptive value as follows:

* If the tenant's `max_cpu` â‰¤ 8, the number of archiving threads = `max_cpu`.
* If 8 < the tenant's `max_cpu` < 32, the number of archiving threads = the tenant's `max_cpu`/2, with a minimum value of 8.
* If the tenant's `max_cpu` > 32, the number of archiving threads = the tenant's `max_cpu`/4, with a minimum value of 16.

## Examples

* The following example shows how to adjust the log archiving parallelism for the `sys` tenant in the MySQL user tenant.

    ```sql
    alter system set log_archive_concurrency = 5 tenant = 'mysql';
    ```

* The following example shows how to adjust the log archiving parallelism for the MySQL tenant itself.

    ```sql
    alter system set log_archive_concurrency = 5;
    ```
