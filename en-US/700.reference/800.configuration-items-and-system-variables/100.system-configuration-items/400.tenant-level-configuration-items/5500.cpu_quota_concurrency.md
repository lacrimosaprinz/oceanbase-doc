# cpu_quota_concurrency

`cpu_quota_concurrency` specifies the maximum concurrency allowed for each CPU quota of a tenant.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>The effective scope is changed to Tenant since OceanBase Database V4.1.0. The value range is changed from [1, 10] to [1, 20] since OceanBase Database V4.2.0. </p>
</main>

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------|
| Type | Double-precision floating-point number |
| Default value | 4 |
| Value range | \[1, 20\] |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |

The number of threads that can be concurrently handled by a tenant is controlled by two parameters: `cpu_quota_concurrency` and `workers_per_cpu_quota`. The two parameters must meet the following condition:

`workers_per_cpu_quota > cpu_quota_concurrency`

* `workers_per_cpu_quota` specifies the maximum number of worker threads that a tenant can allocate to each CPU.

   For more information about `workers_per_cpu_quota`, see [workers_per_cpu_quota](../300.cluster-level-configuration-items/23200.workers_per_cpu_quota.md).

* `cpu_quota_concurrency` specifies the number of active worker threads of the tenant on each CPU, that is, the number of concurrent worker threads.

  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>We recommend that you do not modify this parameter. If you decrease the value of this parameter, performance and even stability may be affected. If you increase the value of this parameter, memory usage and CPU utilization may increase. </p>
