The following example shows how to connect to OceanBase Database by using a local Unix socket:

```sql
obclient -S /home/admin/oceanbase/run/sql.sock -u******@obtenant -p******
```

where

* `-S` specifies the path to the Unix socket file for the local OBServer node. The file is named `sql.sock` and is in the `run/` directory in the local OBServer installation directory. The default value is `/home/admin/oceanbase/run/sql.sock`.
* `-u` specifies the tenant account name in the Username@Tenant name format.
  
You can connect to only a local OBServer node by using a Unix socket connection. Make sure that the resources of the tenant are distributed across local OBServer nodes. Otherwise, you cannot connect to the tenant by using the local OBServer node.
