## Considerations

The workspace memory refers to the memory used by blocking operators such as SQL sorting. It is controlled by the tenant system variable `ob_sql_work_area_percentage`, with a default value of 5%. That is, `workspace memory = tenant memory * ob_sql_work_area_percentage (default 5%)`.

If there is a high level of concurrent requests and each request consumes a significant amount of workspace memory, it may result in errors due to insufficient workspace memory. This often occurs in scenarios involving `union`, `sort`, `group by`, and so on. If such problems arise, they can be mitigated by increasing the value of the system variable. Here is an example:

  ```shell
  obclient> SET GLOBAL ob_sql_work_area_percentage = 10;
  ```
