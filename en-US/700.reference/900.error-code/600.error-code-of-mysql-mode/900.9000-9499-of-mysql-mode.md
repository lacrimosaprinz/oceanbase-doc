--------------------------------------------------------------------

* OceanBase error code: 9202

* Cause: The automatic disk scaling does not start due to possible configuration issues or because the disk usage has reached the upper limit specified by `datafile`.

* Solution: Check whether the value of the `free_size` field in the `__all_virtual_disk_stat` table is 0. If yes, the disk space is exhausted. You must increase the `datafile` threshold or disk size.
