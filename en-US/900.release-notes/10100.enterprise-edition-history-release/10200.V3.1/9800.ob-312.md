# OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition V3.1.2

## V3.1.2 BP9

### Version information

* Release date: July 28, 2022
* Version: V3.1.2 BP9
* RPM version: oceanbase-3.1.2-20220727191622

### Fixed issues

* Values of CPU-related parameters in the `__all_virtual_server_stat` virtual table are inaccurate. 
* In the online analytical processing (OLAP) business model, the execution efficiency of BROADCAST and NEST LOOP JOIN operators is low. 
* The `index status not match` error exists in the logs of the RootServer module. 
* If the server and client use different character sets, the error code 4013 is returned in data export due to excessive memory resource use. 
* If an SQL statement in the `SQL_AUDIT` view contains unidentifiable characters, data cannot be exported. 
* The background threads of an OBServer node use a global index but an initialization exception occurs, causing the OBServer node to crash. 
* The value of the `min_buf_size` parameter does not incorporate the value of the `row_extend_size` parameter. As a result, the `Buffer not enough` error is returned for a large number of data queries. 
* If the amount of data is large when a stored procedure is executed, `tmp_block_cache` occupies a large amount of memory space. As a result, an error indicating insufficient memory is returned. 

## V3.1.2 BP8


### Version information

* Release date: March 30, 2022

* Version: V3.1.2 BP8

* RPM version: oceanbase-3.1.2-20220329234820

### Fixed issues

* The `v$sql_audit` view displays inaccurate `ELAPSED_TIME`. 

* An unexpected error is returned when duplicate data is written into a unique index column. 

* An error is returned when using different verification character sets in combination. 

* The backup data cannot be cleaned up if the `backup_copies` field of the `backup_dest_option` parameter is set to 1. 

* The execution result of the `SELECT INTO USER VARIABLE` parameter in MySQL mode is `NULL`. 

* An error is returned during the conversion of input parameters in PL statements. 

* The PL call of specified parameter names causes status exceptions of the `CFMS.FAUT_GENERATE_SENDDATE` package. 

* Some partition groups are not backed up or the system considers the schema incorrect because the schema version retrieved upon the initiation of the data backup task is inaccurate. 

* The `4013` error is returned when the SQL statement specifies different character set types for the server and the client. 


## V3.1.2 BP7


### Version information

* Release date: February 24, 2022

### Enhanced features

* Unbinding the primary and standby clusters is supported.

* The time consumption statistics for multistmt transactions are inaccurate in the ~v$sql_audit~ view. 

* An OBServer cannot restart when the disk is fully occupied by slog files. 

* A database has duplicate constraints because the constraints on a temporary table in Oracle mode are not in the constraint namespace. 

* The uncommitted data records cannot be queried by nested queries on followers. 

* When a view is created with a prefixed index, the `SUBSTR` expression is generated in an invalid format.

## V3.1.2 BP5


### Version information

* Release date: November 19, 2021

* Version: V3.1.2 BP5

* The execution of the `DROP COLUMN` statement fails because of the delayed drop mechanism. 

* After a table is dropped in MySQL mode, an error is returned during the revocation of user privileges, indicating that the table does not exist. 

* The `4013` error is returned if the number of arguments of the `CONCAT_WS()` function exceeds 32. 

* The synchronization of clog files fails during the upgrade from OceanBase Database V2.2.77 to V3.1.2.

### Fixed issues

* An error is returned for JDBC recognition because the transaction isolation levels of OceanBase Database in MySQL mode are not the same as those of a MySQL database. 

* Slog overwriting causes a restart failure and the failure cannot be recovered. 

* After the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement is executed on a table, the eviction of distributed plans associated with this table is slow.
