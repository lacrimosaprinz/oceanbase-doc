# OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition V3.1.1


## Version information


* Release date: May 18, 2021

* Version: V3.1.1
  
* RPM version: oceanbase-3.1.1-20210508100750

## Overview


OceanBase Database V3.1.1 is a beta version. It is used for proof of concept (POC) in internal and external projects. 

## Enhanced features


* The synchronous write logic of clog files is optimized. The use of shared memory is disabled. The reliability of log data in case of database faults is improved. 

* The queue size of the `gv$sql_audit` view is optimized to support the caching of 10 million records. 

* The values of the `execute_time` and `get_plan_time` fields in the `gv$sql_audit` view are optimized. 

* The `ASIN()` and `ACOS()` functions are supported in MySQL mode. 

## Fixed issues


* Garbled characters are generated at the client during the conversion of character sets of the `LOB` type columns when row records are returned. 

* If the `EXISTS` subquery contains `NULL` or `COUNT(*)`, the result set is incorrect. 

* The SQL execution plan fails to hit the plan cache because of the sensitive matching of sorting rules. 

* The execution of the `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%%'` statement takes a large portion of time. 

* The `4179` error is returned when the `upgrade_checker` script is executed during the upgrade of both primary and standby clusters.
